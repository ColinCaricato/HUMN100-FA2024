               Victim Happy Before Death
               [Antonio Moreno](moreno)  Tells of Phone Conversation With Him
                     at 7 o'clock Night of Tragedy

            The assassination of [William Desmond Taylor](taylor) , Wednesday night,
               postponed forever an engagement which the film director had
               with [Antonio Moreno](moreno) , film star, on
                     Thursday morning. When [Moreno](moreno)  talked with [Taylor](taylor)  over the
                  telephone
               Wednesday night, about 7 o'clock, [Taylor](Taylor)  was in the best of spirits, according to [Moreno's](moreno)  story told yesterday.
            But when the time came for the appointment to
               be fulfilled the following morning, between 10 and 10:30
                  o'clock, the film director's corpse lay in
               a local undertaking company's morgue, pierced by a
                  murderer's bullet. [Moreno](moreno)  said yesterday that he had been an intimate friend
               of [Taylor](taylor)  for several years, since the
               time [Taylor](taylor)  had become associated with the old Vitagraph Company at Santa
                  Monica in 1914.
            "He was one of the finest men I ever met," "[Tony](moreno) "
               said. "He had the highest ideals, I believe, of any man I've ever met in the
               profession." Details of a dinner party which he attended with
                  [Taylor](taylor) , [Miss Betty Francisco](betty) 
               and [Miss Claire Windsor](windsor) , at the Ambassador Hotel
               Thursday night, January 27, were given by
                  [Moreno](moreno) , as well as an informal meeting
               held between [Moreno](moreno) , [Taylor](taylor) , [Arthur Hoyt](hoyt)  and [a Captain Robinson](robinson)  [sic], January 28, at
                  [Moreno's](moreno) 
               room at the Los Angeles Athletic Club.
            "I left them there about 7 o'clock," [Moreno](moreno)  said, "to go to a dinner party at
                  the Ambassador, which I had arranged for
                  [a friend](relationship)  visiting here from Chicago. Later, I understand, the three went to dinner at a roadhouse between
                  Los Angeles and Pasadena--I do not know its name--and then on to the
                  Annandale Club
               after dinner, finally going to [Taylor's](taylor) 
               home."
            [Moreno](moreno)  declared he had spent about two
                     hours last Monday with [Taylor](taylor) 
               at the Vitagraph studio, where [Moreno](moreno)  is working. He had an appointment with
               him for Tuesday, also, but the director, according to [Moreno](moreno) , did not fill it because of a
                  trip to Mount Lowe on location.
            "Then I called him again Wednesday night," [Moreno](moreno)  said, "about 6 o'clock. His boy,
                  [Henry](henry) , answered the
                  phone. [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was not
                  at home. However, he called me later, about 7,
               and we arranged that I should call for [Mr. Taylor](taylor) ,
               at the Lasky studio, about 10 o'clock
                     Thursday morning. [Mr. Hoyt](hoyt)  was with me in
                  my room at the time. [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was to go with me to the Vitagraph studio, on a matter of personal business."
            "But--" and here [Moreno](moreno)  gave a sorrowful shake of
               his head--"But you know the rest. The appointment was not fulfilled--and never will be. "I feel that in
                  [Mr. Taylor's](taylor) 
               death I've lost one of the best friends I've
               ever know. And I'll do everything in my power to run down [the man who killed him](perpatrator) ."

               LOS ANGELES TIMES Film Star Aids [Police](law)  Search
                  [Tony Moreno](moreno)  With [Taylor](taylor) 
               Before Shooting
               Director Was Healthy and Cheerful, Says Friend Check on Events
               of Week Taken by [Officers](enforcement) 

            [William D. Taylor](taylor)  appeared to be in the best of
               health and spirits about one hour before he was shot down in his own
                  apartment at 404-B South Alvarado Street. He did not appear to have any
               premonition of what lay in store for him, although, according to the [police](law)  theory of the slaying of the film director,
               the [murderer](perpatrator)  was then lurking in the shadows a few feet away
               from [Mr. Taylor](taylor) .
            This was disclosed yesterday by [Tony Moreno](moreno) ,
                  Vitagraph star. [Mr.
                  Moreno's](moreno)  story of his conversations with the slain director on the
               night of the murder and for a week prior to the shooting, furnish an
               important check on [Mr. Taylor's](taylor)  movement for at
               least seven days preceding the shooting. "I played golf with [Mr. Taylor](taylor) 
               exactly a week before his death. We drove to the San Gabriel Country Club and remained there from about noon
                  till dark. While there I introduced him to [Asa
                  Keyes, the Deputy District Attorney](keyes) ." [Mr.
                  Moreno](moreno)  said yesterday at his apartment, in the Los Angeles Athletic
                  Club.
            "The next day I saw him again. I met him at the
                  Ambassador at a party. [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was with [Miss Claire
                  Windsor](windsor) . I saw him leave the hotel with her.
               There were a number of picture people there that night.
                     "Saturday night--that is, a week ago
                     tonight--[Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was here
                  in the club. He was in my room and
               with us were [Arthur Hoyt](hoyt)  and [Capt.
                  Robertson](robertson) , who is a close friend of [Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor) . We sat and talked a while. Then [Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor) , [Mr. Hoyt](hoyt)  and [Capt.
                  Robertson](robertson)  left. Later I learned they drove to Cedar Grove,
                  near Pasadena, and had something to eat there. From there they drove
               to the Annandale Country Club.
            "I saw [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  next at the Lasky studios, Monday morning
               at 10 o'clock. I had an appointment with him to go to the Vitagraph
                  studios, on a matter of business importance to me. [Chester Bennett](bennett)  of the Brunton
                  studios, was with us. We were together until 12:30 p.m. that
                  day. "We were unable to see the people we wanted that day. The
                  appointment had to be made over again. I called [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  again, Tuesday at the Lasky
                  lot, but I did not get to talk to him. I was informed that he was out
               on location on Mt. Lowe. Tuesday, which was the day
                  before the murder, I could not get in touch with him.
            "Wednesday night
               [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  called me at the
                  club. I was in [Mr. Hoyt's](hoyt) 
               room, when the call came. We discussed the business appointment I wanted [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  to participate in. As near as I can now recall it, it was
                  about 7 o'clock when [Mr. Taylor](taylor) 
               called. He did not tell me much about his trip to Mt. Lowe.
            "[Mr. Hoyt](hoyt)  was present at the conversation. It lasted
                  several minutes. [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  then
               made an appointment for Thursday
                     morning, at 10 o'clock. He appeared to be in best of spirits. He
               was pleasant and cheerful. "It was a few minutes after 7 that [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  hung up. Then [Mr.
                  Hoyt](hoyt)  and I went to the club
                  dining-room and stayed there for dinner. "Thursday morning, [Mr. Hoyt](hoyt)  called me and told me I would not be able to keep
               the appointment with [Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor)  because he was dead. He then told me what he read in the
               papers."
            [The investigators](enforcement) 
               last night began to check up the facts supplied by [Mr. Moreno](moreno)  in an effort to supply the missing links and
               thus account for every action and movement of the [slain director](director) . [Mr. Moreno's](moreno)  story supplied much important data, the
                  [officers](enforcement)  say.
