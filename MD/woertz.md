               back, dead. 
            NANCE: Was [his](taylor) 
               body rigid and cold?

            ZIEGLER: The [owner](jessurun)  of the building; [Mr.
                  MacLean](dougMacLean) ; another [movie actor](maigne) 
                  [[Charles Maigne](maigne) ], and [Peavey](peavey) .

            NANCE: You mean the [owner](jessurun)  of the building, [Mr.
                  Jessurun](jessurun) ?

            ZIEGLER: Yes, [sir](nance) , and [Mr. MacLean](dougMacLean)  and another man I don't know.

                  night previous?

            ZIEGLER: I did. I learned that from [Mrs.
                  MacLean](faithMacLean) , that along about fifteen or perhaps ten minutes to
                  eight,
               the night before, [she](faithMaclean)  heard
                  a shot. [She](faithMacLean)  thought it was a gunshot. [She](faithMacLean)  went to [her](faithMacLean) 
               front door and opened the door, and saw a [man](murderer)  standing in [Mr. Taylor's](taylor) 
               door. [She](faithMacLean)  looked at [him](murderer) , and [he](murderer)  stood and looked at [her](faithMacLean) ; and [he](murderer)  walked down the
                  steps, turned to the left, and going

            NANCE: Did [Mr. Jessurun](jessurun)  tell you [he](jessurun)  heard a shot?

            ZIEGLER: [He](jessurun)  did not. [He](jessurun)  didn't know but what it was an automobile making a noise.

            NANCE: Did [Mr. MacLean](dougMacLean)  endeavor to investigate
               it?

            ZIEGLER: Not that I know of, and [Mrs. MacLean's maid](maid) 
               also heard a shot.

            NANCE: Did they say why they didn't attempt
               to investigate the cause of the shot?

            ZIEGLER: They did not.

            NANCE: Did you find any weapon about
                  theroom where the deceased was lying?

            ZIEGLER: I found a  weapon in the room above.

            NANCE: Where was it?

            ZIEGLER: In the front bedroom in the dresser drawer, lying on a sort of box.

            NANCE: Did you investigate to see whether the
                  clothing was powder
                  burnt or not?

            ZIEGLER: I did not. That was investigated,
               I understand, later.

            NANCE: Did you ask any of the persons who were called by
                  [Henry Peavey, the valet](peavy) , whether there was any
                  weapon there when they first came into the
                  room?

            ZIEGLER: Yes, [sir](nance) . We looked for everything of that
               kind.

            NANCE: Have you formed any conclusion whether it
               was possible this shot could have been fired by
               the deceased
               [himself](taylor) ?
            ZIEGLER: Impossible.

            THE CORONER: Have you any questions, gentlemen?

            NANCE: By a [juror](juror) : Was the revolver found upstairs
               loaded? 

            ZIEGLER: It was. It had five shells in it; it had
               not been shot of late. 

            NANCE: Was it the same caliber bullet as was
               found on the [deceased](taylor) ?

            ZIEGLER: This was a .32 automatic Savage.

            NANCE: In the drawer
               upstairs?

            ZIEGLER: Yes.

            NANCE: What was the number of the bullet that was
               found? 

            ZIEGLER: I understand that it was a .38. I
               haven't seen it.

            THE CORONER: That is all, you may be excused. That is all the evidence we will take in this case. All but the
                  [Jury](jury)  will be excused. 
            I hereby certify that I, as a [shorthand reporter](allen) ,
               correctly took down in shorthand the testimony and proceedings had at the within named
                  [Coroner's](callen) 
               inquest; that the foregoing is a full, true and
               correct copy of my shorthand
               notes and a full, true and correct statement
               of the testimony and proceedings had at said
                  inquest. [E.M.
                  Allen](allen) , Shorthand Reporter 
             _____ 

            DETECTIVE STATEMENTS

            MR. CAHILL: We tested that and the bullet --- the gun was
               not more than an inch away from [his body](taylor)  and they
               couldn't possibly get that close. 
            MR. WOOLWINE: I heard it was 2 to 4 inches.

            MR. CAHILL: No, we have got it to within an inch, the test shows that.

            MR. WINN: In my opinion, the shot that was fired
               4 inches from the pants in making
                  that demonstration, is the nearest likeness to
               the shot in the coat.
