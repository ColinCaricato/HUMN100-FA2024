             MEMORANDUM RE: [JAMES KIRKWOOD](kirkwood)  AND [MARY MILES MINTER](minter) 

            [James Kirkwood](kirkwood) , [actor and motion-picture director](kirkwood) , was
               [Mary Miles Minter's](minter)  [first director](kirkwood)  when she commenced making
               pictures for the American Film Company in Santa
                  Barbara in 1916. [She](minter)  was 15 years of age at the time.

            [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  then consummated the marriage in a much more mundane way as a result of
               which [Mary](minter)  became pregnant. Intercourse went on for a number of months.

            [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  then left for New York (late 1916 or early in 1917) and a
               clandestine correspondence commenced between the two. [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  wrote a series of
                  letters to [Mary](minter) . These were sent to another male member of the motion-picture company
               who delivered the missives to [Mary](minter) . The letters were in plain white envelopes labeled
               [“Juliet”](minter) . (Mary' s true name was Juliet Reilly.) In the meantime [Mary's](minter)  condition was
               causing [her mother](cshelby) , [Mrs. Charlotte Shelby](cshelby) , (always a [suspect](cshelby)  in the [Taylor](taylor)  murder,)
               much concern. The [girl's](minter)  weight continued to increase and [the mother](cshelby)  tried all kinds
               of diets.
 
            The correspondence between [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  and [Mary](minter)  continued, but [the mother](cshelby)  at last
               intercepted one of the letters. [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  at the time was staying at the Lamb's Club
               in New York. [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  tore up the ground, to use Kary1s words, when [she](cshelby)  found out
               what was going on.

            [Mary](minter)  was forced to write a letter to [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  saying that they had been found out and
               that her mother insisted that their romance end at once. Also the mother insisted
               that [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  return letters written to [him](kirkwood)  by [Mary](minter) . 

            [The mother](cshelby)  then took this collection of letters and kept them in a safe-deposit box.
               They were given to [Mary](minter)  recently when [Mary's sister](mshelby) , [Margaret Fillmore](mshelby) , had a falling
               out with [her mother](cshelby) . [The mother](cshelby)  supposedly kept these letters to hold over Mary's
               head but [Mary](minter)  says that throughout the many rows between [her](minter)  and [her mother](cshelby)  since
               that the latter never mentioned the missives.
            
            [Margaret](mshelby)  says that her mother once declared she was keeping the letters so if anyone
               ever accused [her](cshelby)  of murdering [Taylor](taylor)  that [she](cshelby)  could prove that if [she](cshelby)  was ever going
               to murder anyone [she](cshelby)  would have murdered [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  at the time.
            
            The assortment of letters from [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  contain little factual evidence and are
               mostly devoted to the outpouring of a [man](kirkwood)  obviously infatuated with [the young screen
               star](minter) . He speaks of writing two and three letters a day and all the missives were
               ended in a long series of “X’s” or kisses.
            
            Typical of the character of these fervent letters is the following extract: "[My
               sweetheart](minter) , [my wife](minter) , [the mother of my children](minter) .” The last salutation was
               underlined.

            In the letter [Mary](minter)  wrote telling [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  that all was over [she](minter)  mentions an·
               "operation" performed: by [Dr. Hutchison](Hutchison) . It seems that [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  or [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby) 
               arranged for this abortion. 
            
            Only five persons, says [Mary](minter) , ever knew of the extent of this romance. These were [her
               mother,](cshelby)  [her grandmother](miles) , now dead, [her sister](mshelby)  and [Kirkwood](kirkwood) .
            
            [Mary](minter)  claims that this definitely ended her romance with [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  and that when she
               met [William Desmond Taylor](taylor)  a year or two later that [she](minter)  realized that [her](minter)  affair with
               [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  was merely an infatuation and that [she](minter)  really was in love with [Taylor](taylor) .
            
            She says, however, that a year after Taylor's murder in February, 1922, that [Kirkwood](kirkwood) 
               came to [her](minter)  and wanted to marry her. She says she refused him because she was still
               in love with Taylor's ghost and a short time later, having obtained a divorce from
               [his first wife](Lila)  [he](taylor)  married [Lila Lee](Lila) .
            
            Investigation at the present time, although handicapped by the passage of time,
               indicates that [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  was in Los Angeles at the time of the Taylor murder at about
               7:45 P.M. on the night of February 1, 1922. [He](kirkwood)  may even have been working on the same
                  lot with [Mary](minter) .
            
            Old directories of the period give his address as the Los Angeles Athletic C1ub, then
               the habitat of many screen personalities including [Mickey Neilan](Neilan)  and others. It was at the club that a story was widely circu1lated that [Mary](minter)  one night went to Taylor's
               bungalow and taking off all [her](mary)  clothes begging [him](taylor)  to have intercourse with [her](mary) .
               Mrs. Shelby is said to have arrived a few minutes after Mary left and demanded [her
               daughter](mary) . [Taylor](taylor)  refused to have anything to do with [the girl](mary)  after. It is well
               established, however, that [the mother](cshelby)  considered [Taylor](taylor)  a menace to her control over
               [her money-making daughter](minter)  and hated [him](taylor)  accordingly.
            
            In a statement taken in New York in 1925 by former Chief Deputy District [Attorney
               Harold Davis](Attorney)  [Mary](minter)  recites that [her mother](cshelby)  "tore"' up the earth when any man came
               around her.” She recalled on one occasion, according to the transcript or the
                  statement, that she was present at a railroad station in Santa Barbara or Los Angeles.
               with [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  and others and the [mother](cshelby) , 'being momentarily displeased with [Mary](minter) ,
               asserted that [she](cshelby)  would kill anyone that came between [her](cshelby)  and [Mary](minter) ,” man or woman and
               even included a dog belonging to one of the company.

            The theory of every person closely connected with the [Taylor](taylor)  case – Taylor’s personal
               friends, intimates of the Shelby family -- has always been that [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  either
               killed [Taylor](taylor)  or influenced some other person to do it. It appears that [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  had
               a romantic interest in [Mary](minter)  at the time of the murder and was also in a position to
               have been under the domination of [Mrs.Shelby](cshelby) --[he](kirkwood)  had committed statutory rape when
               he had intercourse with [Mary](minter)  at the age or 15 and [he](kirkwood)  was still married to [his](kirkwood)  first
               wife in 1922 and seeking a divorce.

            [The main witness](dougMaclean)  in the [Taylor](taylor)  murder at the time of its commission was [Mrs. Douglas
               MacLean](dougMaclean) , [wife](dougMaclean)  or the [comedian](dougMaclean)  who lived in a bungalow nearby. [She](dougMaclean)  heard a shot and
               looked out in time to see a [man](murderer)  leaving the Taylor house. This was unquestionably the
               [murderer](murderer) . She says it could not have been a [woman](murderer)  dressed in man's clothing. The
               description given at the time closely resembles that of [Kirkwood](kirkwood) . In addition [Mrs.
               MacLean](dougMaclean)  said that the person appeared to [her](dougMaclean)  to resemble someone in a motion-picture
               get-up or in makeup.

            Another [witness](witness)  recalls seeing [two men](murderer)  at Taylor's door two nights before the murder
               at about 6:00 P.M. These were described as [tall men](murderer)  ([Kirkwood](kirkwood)  was six feet and
               weighed 180 pounds) and [a very small man](murderer)  weighing about 125 pounds.
