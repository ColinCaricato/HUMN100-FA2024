             W. A. ROBERTSON, friend of Mr. Taylor. Statement taken 2-9-22 at 8 P.M.

            POLICE: Were you ever present when [Mr. Taylor](taylor) 
               mentioned [Mary Miles Minter](minter) ?

            ROBERTSON: Yes.

             POLICE: What was the occasion?

            ROBERTSON: That was last Saturday night.

             POLICE: Who, if anyone else was present?

            ROBERTSON: [Mr. Hoyt](hoyt) .

            POLICE: He said she had been pesticating around there and got to be a great deal of
               annoyance.

             ROBERTSON: No, that was last Saturday *** that was the 28th.

            POLICE: 28th of January?

             ROBERTSON: Yes. She would come to his house and kick up a
               fuss.

             POLICE: What did he tell you about her kicking up a fuss?

            ROBERTSON: She threatened to scream. She was very obnoxious to
               him and all of these attentions.

             POLICE (By Mr. Cato): were you ever with [Miss
                  Windsor](windsor)  and [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  and [Miss Blanche Street](blanche)  and [Marshal
                  Neilan](neilan)  and a couple of other girls at a caf√©
               when [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  taunted [Neilan](neilan)  regarding [Miss Minter](minter) ?

            MR. CHARLES EYTON Gen. Mgr. Famous Players-Lasky Statement taken 11-30-25 at 2:20
               PM

             A. (Speaking of the morning following the murder) ** I was called on the
                  telephone, I should judge at 8 by his
               assistant [Harry Fellows](harryFellows) , and he told me. He said,
                  "[Mr. Eyton](eyton) , when I came over to [Mr. Taylor's](taylor)  room this morning, I
                  found him dead." And I says, "Dead? What is the matter?" He
               says "Well, we have had a [docto](doctor)  here and he tells
               us it is a hemorhhage of the stomach. **

            A. That would make it about 8:30, I should judge.
             A. I didn't go through the house. [Charley Maigne](maigne)  and [Arthur Hoyt](hoyt)  and
                  [Douglas MacLean](dougMaclean)  and [Harry
                  Fellows](harryFellows) .
             A. ** [Douglas MacLean](dougMaclean)  was the first man that put
               it into my head that he ([Taylor](taylor) ) was
                  murdered. He said he was confident that he had heard a
                  shot
               the night before. He said to me, "[Charley](maigne) , don't let them take his body away with out turning it over,
               because I think we heard a shot last night."

             Q. Have you any idea who did the telephoning around about
                  the murder?
             A. No. [Harry Fellows](harryFellows) 
               telephoned me.
             Q. Did you hear anybody call up [Mabel Normand](normand)  or
                  [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby) ?
            A. No. That all happened before I got there, if [Mrs.
                  Shelby](cshelby)  was called up. [Mabel Normand](normand) 
               was called up, I know. [Charley Maigne](maigne)  told me.
             Q. What was the position of the body when you first saw
               it?
             A. The body when I first saw it lay right in
                  front of the desk, with the head back. The desk was near
                  his feet.

             A. ** Of course [Mary](mary)  was engaged to
                  marry
               [Mickey Neilan](mickeyNeilan) , so she told me, but I don't think
               there was very much to that.
            Q. This trouble with [Taylor](taylor) , when was that?
             A. He and [Mickey](mickeyNeilan) ? Oh, [Mickey](neilan)  said something one night. They were drunk and
                  [Mickey](mickeyNeilan)  apologized. It was nothing serious.

            Q. Do you know [Neva Gerber](gerber) ?
             A. Yes. That was one of [Taylor's](taylor)  former flames,
               before any of this came up.
             ** When he went to war it was understood that when he came
               back he was going to marry
               [Neva Gerber](gerber) .

             NEIL HARRINGTON, Neighbor Statement taken 2-9-22

             POLICE: *** I understand you went over with [Mr.
                  Dumas](dumas) ?

             HARRINGTON: I went in there first.

             POLICE: When you saw [Taylor](taylor) 
               lying out
               on the floor, why his clothing was
               perfectly arranged, was it not?

             HARRINGTON: Perfectly arranged. I made the remark at the time, "I don't believe the
               man fell in that position." (Re man peeping in windows of [Taylor's](taylor) 
               home in August, 1921) Between [Taylor's](taylor)  house and the garage, there is the
                  two windows, and [Taylor](taylor) ‚Äôs house the window to the living room and the window to the
               kitchen - *** I saw a man peeking in the curtain, and as he
               saw me‚Äî this man, I believe I would recognize-- as he heard me he started and
               stopped naturally, rather frightened, and he didn't say a word, but whirled right
               around and walked out.

             POLICE: Do you know whether [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was there
               or not?

             HARRINGTON: There was a light in there, *** I should say probably along about the
                  20th of August.

             POLICE: How would you describe the fellow's face?

             HARRINGTON: Rather a good looking fellow, good features. Of course I couldn't tell
               whether his face was ruddy complexion --

             POLICE: Regular features?

            HARRINGTON: Yes, regular features. It wasn't [Taylor's
                  chauffeur](peavey)  at that time.

             POLICE: About what time was it in the evening?

             HARRINGTON: Oh, somewhat around 9 o‚Äôclock, early in the
                  evening.

            ~~~~~

            CHARLES MAIGNE (Friend of Taylor) Statement taken 2-9-22

             MAIGNE: ** After I got over the shock of Bill's
                  death, was wondering how on earth [Bill](taylor)  could have fallen the way he did. The position that [Bill](taylor)  was in stumped me for two solid days *** If he had
               been sitting in his chair and had been shot, or if he
                  had been shot in his back with his
               back to the door, he was lying stretched out with his feet towards the
                  door, hands by his side. There was no
                  blood anywhere except directly under his
                  head where the blood had run out of
                  his mouth from the hemorrhage and a little bit directly
               under where the wound in the back was.

            POLICE: Was the clothing all properly arranged?

            MAIGNE: Clothing all properly
                  arranged. (Speaking of the condition of the room when he first saw
                  it the morning after the murder)

            WINN: There were also papers on the
                  couch? *** I know when you came up there about  9:15 or
                  9:30.

            MAIGNE: Around 9:30 or 10 o'clock. **** Before we had been there a half
               or three-quarters of an hour, I noticed three or four checks
               on the floor alongside of [Bill](taylor) ,
                  cancelled checks. They were not on the
                  floor when I came in. This pile of cancelled
                  checks was almost smooth and level right on his
                  desk, just as though he had been interrupted in his work and nobody
               had touched them. ** On the night after
               [Taylor](taylor)  was killed
               I called up
               [Earl Tiffany](tiffany)  and had him come up to the
                  house. *** His wife came up with him *** The first thing he told me
               was that his wife had positively seen [Sands](sands)  at the
               corner of Fifth and Figueroa, I think it was, at 1:15
                  PM on the day before [Taylor](taylor)  was murdered.
               She had known [Sands](sands)  and [Tiffany](tiffany)  before she married [
               Tiffany](tiffany) .

            (Second Statement taken 12-1-25)

             MAIGNE: It must have been about half past 7 in the morning of the day
               that [Bill](taylor) was killed that [Miss
                  Normand's maid](maid)  came over and wanted to see me right away. *** I hurried
               over and [Mabel](normand)  told me that [Edna Purviance](purviance)  had telephoned to her that
                  [Bill](taylor)  had been found dead. *** and
                  [Mabel](normand)  ** asked me to go up there, and I think there were only
               two or three people here when I got in. It must have been approximately 8
                  o'clock.

            POLICE: About what time was that that you got there?

             MAIGNE: About 8 or 8:30, I should say.The man in the corner court, just
               beyond [Miss Purviance](purviance) , on the same side
                  [Bill](taylor) was on, he said he was reading an Evening
                  Herald and heard the conversation between [Miss
                  Normand](normand)  and [Mr. Taylor](taylor) , and heard them say, "Good
               night", and then the footsteps going back, and then immediately the whirr of the
               motor, and she had gone and the footsteps died out, and he heard the
                  shot.
