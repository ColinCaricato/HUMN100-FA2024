            # Interview with Mary Miles Minter
            *Nick Eisele*
            STATEMENT OF [MISS MARY MILES MINTER](minter) . [G.H BOONE](boone)  OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
               OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Part 5]

            DORAN: This was the second time that [he](neilan)  had
               declared love for you. On one occasion [he](neilan)  proposed
               to [you](minter) ?

            MINTER: Yes.

            DORAN: [He](neilan)  asked [you](minter)  to marry [him](neilan) ?

            MINTER: Yes, and then [he](neilan)  would dart away again. I
               mean [he](neilan)  would call me up -- [He](neilan)  can't call me up, because I have no telephone; [he](neilan)  would send me flowers, too, and suddenly I would not hear from [him](neilan)  for two or three weeks. As I said to
                  [him](neilan)  in the car, not particularly about that but about other things, about
                  dinner engagements, about appointments, I said,
               "You know, [Marshall](neilan) , I never know when l am going
               to see [you](neilan)  and when I am not going to see [you](neilan) , and just what [you](neilan) 
               are going to do, and I am in no mood to go on like that at all; I don't care much
               about it."

            DORAN: When did [you](minter)  tell [him](neilan)  that?

            MINTER: I told [him](neilan)  that when [we](minterneilan)  were driving the car.

            DORAN: How old a [man](neilan)  is [Marshall Neilan](neilan) ?

            MINTER: Just thirty.

            DORAN: Has [he](neilan)  ever been married?

            MINTER: Yes, [he](neilan)  has been married once for a
                  few days. [He](neilan)  remained married to
                  [his wife](neilanwife)  for a long time, for seven
                  years, I think, but [he](neilan)  was actually only
               married a few days. I think [he](neilan)  married when
                  [he](neilan)  was twenty or nineteen.

            DORAN: Have [you](minter)  seen [him](neilan)  since this Friday night?

            MINTER: No, I have not.

            DORAN: Have you talked with [him](neilan)  over the
                  telephone?

            MINTER: It was really Saturday morning.

            DORAN: Has [he](neilan)  called you up on the telephone?

            MINTER: No; [he](neilan)  may have called me at the New Hampshire house and I wouldn't know.

            DORAN: [You](minter)  haven't talked with [him](neilan)  over the telephone?

            MINTER: I haven't seen [him](neilan)  or talked to [him](neilan)  or come in touch with [him](neilan)  in any way

            DORAN: You haven't received any letters from
                  [him](neilan) ?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Did you part friendly or unfriendly?

            MINTER: [We](minterneilan)  did part more or less friendly, as
               I always did with [Marshall](neilan) , no matter how angry I
               would become with [him](neilan) , somehow you can't bear
               malice against that [boy](neilan) .

            DORAN: [You](minter)  have become angry with [him](neilan)  on other occasions?

            MINTER: Yes. This night for the time being, I was furious [missing page] [...]
                  [Mr Neilan](neilan)  -- [Taylor's](taylor) , and at the time of [Mr
                  Taylor](taylor) 's death, [Harry](harry)  was the assistant director in [Mr Taylor's](taylor) 
               companies there, and he had said [Harry](harry)  had been in the
                  room looking over the effects -- Just a minute. I wonder if [Charles Maigne](maigne)  told me this. I think [Mr Neilan](neilan)  told me this, too, that [Harry](harry)  bad gotten the letters
               and taken them to [Jim Vantrees](vantrees) , [the camera man](vantrees) ,
               whereupon I remarked, "I will bet [Mrs Ivers](ivers)  had
               them," and I think [he](vantrees)  said, "[Jim](jim)  gave them to [Mr Eyton](eyton) ," and that [Mr
                  Eyton](eyton)  turned some of them over
               to the [Examiner](examiner) . I am so afraid l am telling
               things that are not so here, [Mr Doran](doran) ; I don't mean
               to, but I couldn't get all of it. That is as clear as I can make it. Anyway, I do
               remember this part, [he](eyton)  said [he](eyton)  heard about them, and I
               don't know how [he](eyton)  heard about them, and that [he](eyton) 
               went down, I believe, to the [Examiner](examiner) , to get
               ahold of them and [he](eyton)  had something to do with Pasadena, a man, he did tell me the man's name.
               I don't remember his name, but I believe it be­gan with "S", and
               this [man](neilan) , [Marshall](neilan)  said he was the [big man](neilan) 
               over the entire Examiner force, told [him](neilan)  to go down and take the letters. [He](neilan)  said, "Of course, if
                  [you](minter)  breathe this it wi11 just about throw
                  [me](neilan)  in jail for the rest of [my](neilan)  life," but I don't believe it will. Then [he](neilan)  said, "Didn't [you](minter)  get
                  them today?" I said, "[I](minter)  did not." As well as I remember, [Marshall](neilan)  said, "I then sent them to the Realart Studio and
               they ought to be in [Charley](charley) 's hands now or
                  [Mr Garbut](garbut) ." This whole Friday night
               is most hasy in my recollection.

            DORAN: This [man](neilan)  knew before [you](minter)  were in love with [Mr Taylor](taylor) ?

            MINTER: Oh, yes.

            DORAN: [You](minter)  had told [him](neilan)  that, had [you](minter)  not?

            MINTER: No; in fact, I had never said to [Marshall](neilan) 
                  "[I](minter)  am in love with [William Desmond Taylor](taylor) ." I never had.

            DORAN: How did [he](neilan)  find it out, then?

            MINTER: [He](neilan)  knew about it, because [we](mintertaylor)  had been friends a long time. Before this
                  [Marshall](neilan)  had come to my house very despondent and said, "I think [I](neilan)  will go out in the garden
               and eat wooly worms." I said, "Don't feel that way; there are plenty of us who feel
               the same way." I am certain [he](neilan)  knew about
                  this thing. I made no secret of
                  it, but I didn't promenade it
               about.

            DORAN: Don't [you](minter)  have a recollection of having told
                  [him](neilan) , [Marshall
                  Neilan](neilan) , that you were fond of [Taylor](taylor) ?

            MINTER: No. Many times I said, "I admire [Mr Taylor](taylor) ;
               I respect [him](taylor) ; [you](neilan)  know I respect his opinion; what a [wonderful man](taylor)  I consider [him](taylor)  to be."
                  [He](neilan)  knew I regarded [him](taylor)  most highly.

            DORAN: Do you remember if [he](neilan)  asked you at the time
                  [he](neilan) 
               pro­posed to you if you were in love with any one
               else?

            MINTER: No, [he](neilan)  didn't ask me that at all.

            DORAN: Did you have any admirers who might have been jealous of [him](neilan) ?

            MINTER: There was only one possible [admirer](dickson) , and
               that was [Mr Dickson](dickson) .

            DORAN: Any besides [Mr Dickson](dickson) ?

            MINTER: No; in fact, if I may say so, neither [Mr
                  Dickson](dickson)  nor [Mr Neilan](neilan)  has been with
               me constantly enough, or I feel really care enough for me to do any such thing in my
               behalf, I mean such as commit murder. In my own
               mind I am absolutely convinced that I know they would not.

            DORAN: [You](minter)  think they are incapable, in other
               words?

            MINTER: I absolutely do.

            DORAN: What kind of cigarettes was [Neilan](neilan)  smoking the night at the studio?

            MINTER: [He](neilan)  smokes two kinds of cigarettes. [He](neilan) 
               smokes a gold tipped called "Dimi"
               something from Egypt, I forget the name,
                  "D" something; I noticed it comes from Cairo; then [he](neilan)  smokes Chesterfield cigarettes. At least, I have seen
                  [him](neilan)  smoking Chesterfield cigarettes. I remember that much, because I have always
               admired the face of the Chesterfield
                  boy on that red back
                  sign, you know, that laughing
                  boy in the light hair that says, "Gee"! They satisfy!"

            DORAN: Did [Neilan](neilan)  take [you](minter)  home then that morning from the studio or did [you](minter)  go
               back in your own car?

            MINTER: No; my car had been driven back to
               its garage by [Mr
                  Neilan's chauffeur](neilanchauffeur)  with my [friend](scarborough) 
               [Mr Scarborough](scarborough)  in it. Poor [Mr Scarborough](scarborough)  had been driving around with me
                  all evening. I hadn't been able to sleep and that was why I ws_ out.
                  [He](scarborough)  said if I didn't mind [he](scarborough)  would just go on back home, now that I was in safe
               hands, and get some sleep. [He](scarborough)  was pretty near
               dead tired. [He](scarborough)  isn't a very strong man.

            DORAN: So [Neilan](neilan)  took [you](minter) 
               home then

            MINTER: Yes; right straight home.

            DORAN: Did [he](neilan)  ask you to keep in confidence the
                  conversation
               you had had with [him](neilan) ? Did
                  [he](neilan)  tell you not to say anything about it?

            MINTER: l don't remember [him](neilan)  saying to me, "You
               must keep this all in secret oonfidenoe"; no, I do not, because when [we](minterneilan)  got home
               we discussed some of the things with [mother](cshelby) , with
               the whole family, in fact; [he](neilan)  discussed the
               seriousness of the conversation and told
               me not to do anything without my [at­torneys](legal) .

            DORAN: [He](neilan)  told you that?

            MINTER: Yes; [he](neilan)  said, "You
               mustn't make any move without your [attorneys](legal) ."
                  [He](neilan)  spoke of [Mr
                  Mott](mott)  and said [Mr Mott](mott)  was very able and
               that [he](mott)  would tell me the right thing to do and not
               to make a move without [him](neilan) .

            DORAN: Did [you](minter)  comment on [his](neilan)  concern?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Did [you](minter)  say anything to [him](neilan) , for instance to this effect: "Why should [you](neilan)  be so concerned about [me](minter) ? Why should [I](minter)  consult [attorneys](legal)  in connection with this
                  affair?" or anything like that?

            MINTER: No, I did not, because at the time, when I asked [him](neilan)  if [he](neilan)  suspected me of killing
               Mr Taylor, we had that out; [he](neilan) 
               assured me [he](neilan)  didn't suspect any such thing, but
                  [he](neilan)  was very much impressed with the gravity of
               the situation. In fact, evidently [he](neilan)  knew at that
               time exactly how these things were going to turn out. I mean that they would drag
               everybody's name into it; that the papers could
               get hold of for the notoriety of it. [He](neilan)  said, "This
               involves picture people and you know how [Hearst](hearst)  hates the picture
                  people. [Hearst](hearst)  would do anything
                  [he](hearst)  could if [he](hearst) 
               thought you did know [Mr Taylor](taylor) ," "There are lots of
               prominent people in the profession who knew [him](taylor)  and loved [him](taylor) . They
               are certainly going to drag your name into it."

            DORAN: [You](minter)  didn't telephone
               [Taylor](taylor)  on the night he was
                  murdered?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Where did [you](minter)  happen to be that night?

            MINTER: I was at home reading the Cruise of the
                  Kewa. It is a humorous
               book; it is really a travesty of Frederick
                  O'Brien's stories of the South Seas. It is very funny, and I laid
               there laughing all the evening. I was very -- right while I was laying
               on the couch reading aloud to [mother](cshelby)  and sister and we were all laughing heartily at
               that time, and at the same time [Mr Taylor](taylor)  was
                  being murdered. It seems very horrible to
               me.

            DORAN: [You](minter)  had no company at home
               that night?

            MINTER: Let me see. I don't remember any. Possibly [Mr
                  Stockdale](stockdale) , he generally did, or maybe somebody dropped in. I don't just
               remember. Usually every evening somebody drops in. I know they were not there at the
               time I was reading the book.

            DORAN: Your automobiles were all home?

            MINTER: Yes, unless I put my car in the
                  garage called the Standard Garage. I leave it there sometimes, the Standard Garage on Hollywood
                  Boulevard and Western Avenue. Sometimes when my girl friends stop with
               me and have [her](minterfriend) 
               car, I would move out and put it in this
                  garage and maybe wouldn't call for it for
                  several days. I haven't been feeling well for some time; I have had
               bronchitis. I hadn't gotten well when this awful shock came to me, and I haven't used
               the little car very much.

            DORAN: Do you have a [chauffeur](chaucy) ?

            MINTER: Yes; faithful old [Chauncy](chaucy) . [Chauncy](chaucy)  is just as concerned about this thing as [my mother](cshelby)  is.

            DORAN: Well, I don't think of anything else I care to inquire about now.

            MINTER: [Mr Doran](doran) , if I can be of any possible help
               in any way, it is true I don't know any more than I have told you; if I can, please
               call on me the first thing, won't you?

            DORAN: Thank you, very much. You may think of little things of which you may not
               appreciate the imporance, [Mr Mott](mott) .

            MINTER: As I told [Mr Mott](mott)  today, I remember saying to
                  [Mr Mott](mott) , "I am so tired I am like a little child.
               I speak words mechanically. I sit, sleep, get up, walk and dress, and I don't see
               exactly what I am doing."
