               home, that [Mary](minter)  would drive over to the house and catch [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  there) She would
               be given to understand he wasn't there, and she would get in her car and come over,
               and find him there. I have seen her coming out of the house as if she were about
               ready to cry her eyes out. ([M.M. Minter](minter) )

               see who slept with the old man last night."

               than [my wife](spouse) .

             POLICE: What was his nationality? 
             [TIFFANY](tiffany) : I think English, with a little Scotch. **** Without a doubt he had a
               wonderful education.

               was down town with him several times, and he carried it with him once or twice to my
               knowledge, and he would stick it alongside the car and I would ask him what was the
               idea, and he just laughed about it, was all, but the man was a coward. **
