             STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT
               ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Section 1] 

            PRESENT: [Mr. W.C. Doran,](doran)  Deputy District Attorney,
                  [Miss Mary Miles Minter,](minter) 
               [John G. Mott,](mott)  attorney for Miss Minter, and [G. H. Boone,](boone)  shorthand reporter.

            STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER

            Questions by [Mr. Doran](doran) : 

             DORAN: How long have you known [Mr taylor](taylor) ?

            MINTER: Since July of 1919 -- yes, that is correct. 

             DORAN: He has been your director in pictures, has he? 

             MINTER: Yes we commenced this company together. 

             DORAN: Did you have occasion to call on him at his
                  residence within  the last thirty days prior
               to his death? -- approximately  thirty days?
            

             MINTER: Just a moment, will you --

             DORAN: Let me change the question. When was the last time you called on him at
                  his residence? 

             MINTER: On the 23rd of December.
            
            DORAN: Were you alone at that time or did others accompany you to see him? 

             MINTER: I was alone. 

             DORAN: Was any one else there?

            MINTER: no, not a soul. 

            DORAN: Was [his valet](Sands) , the colored man, there, do you
               know?

            MINTER: Not that I know of. 

             DORAN: Prior to that time, was it your habit to call on him at his residence or had
               it been your habit?

            MINTER: I couldn't call it a habit, but on several
                  occasions I did call upon him, though never asÂ·1ate as upon this
               occasion.

            DORAN: Now, on this last occasion, whet time of the day or night was it that you
               called? 

            MINTER: May l tell this in my own way? 

            DORAN: Yes, I would rather have you tell it in your own way, if you will.

             MINTER: I am glad to. I am trying to answer as I would in court and 1 don't like to
               do so. 

             DORAN: Just proceed, go ahead and tell it in your own way.

            MINTER: I had gone to bed; I hadn't seen
                  [Mr taylor](taylor)  in five
                  months at the time -- three months, I know; three months, and
               I just got to thinking about it and I decided I couldn't stand it any longer. I was
               going to go up and tell him "goodbye. I got up and dressed, went down to my
                  grandmother's room and I said, ["Mama,](cshelby)  I am going over to say 'goodbye' to Mr taylor,"
               and she advised me not to do it. She said it was too late: "Do you know it is nearly
                  twelve o'clock?" she said. I said, "Yes, sure, but I
               just must do so," I said, "I realize that this is not the usual thing and I have
               never been there so late, but I must do so, Mama. I am going to give him a
                  letter in whioh I have told him 'goodbye,"'
               She said, "All right, then, if you must. I would get up and go with you, but I don't
               feel well enough," Mama often accompanied me on my
                  trips, which were not very many during the entire time that i knew
               him. So I went over there and arrived at five minutes to
                  twelve, I am strange about that, I am rather queer about that, I think of
               the time; every time I was with him I would say, "Well, this time yesterday I didn't
               see him and today I am with him," and things like that. So I arrived at five
                  minutes to twelve and left at ttwenty minutes to
                  one, and-- Do you wish me to tell you all that transpired? 
             DORAN: Never mind about that. 

             DORAN: Your [grandmother](grandmother)  didn't accompany
               you?

             MINTER: No, she did not. 

            DORAN: Your [chauffeur](chaffeur)  drove you there? 

            MINTER: No, I drove myself in my little car,
               little run-about.

             DORAN: That was December 23d? 

             MINTER: Yes, December 23rd.

             DORAN: When was the last time you saw him prior to that? 

             MINTER: I couldn't give you the exact date, but I know it was at least three
                  months and a little over; it was over three months.

            DORAN: During the three months prior to December 23d, did you ever meet him
               anywhere.

             MINTER: No. You mean casually or see him really to talk to? I saw him, yes. 

            DORAN: See him and meet him, to be with him? 
            MINTER: No; no, indeed. I passed him at  Lasky Studio
                when I go over there. Sometimes I have seen his car go down  Western
                  Avenue, but I hadn't seen him to speak to in three months.

             DORAN: As I understand it, you were sincerely in love with him?

             MINTER: That is true.

             DORAN: Did you convey that feeling to him?

            MINTER: Absolutely.

             DORAN: You told him, did you?

            MINTER: Absolutely. He loved me; he told me so.

            DORAN: Were you engaged to be married?

            MINTER: No, we were not.

             DORAN: At the time of his death, it was
               --

             MR. MOTT: Right there at that point you might explain about the rising sun, with
               reference to your engagement. I think that explains the attitude between both of you. 

            MINTER: I don't know just which to do, whether to tell you this whole thing, go right
               along and talk. I can easily do that. 

            MR. MOTT: He asked if you were engaged to him. Tell him about the "rising sun"
               explanation. 

             MINTER: I can tell you the whole thing better without being asked.

             MR. DORAN: Yes. Go ahead. and tell us in your own way all about it.

             MINTER: I had always known that this was just an exquisite chapter in my
                  life that must necessarily be a brief one: I couldn't bear to part
               with it; it was just a beautiful thing that seldom occurs in the. world today as I
               see it, as it is forced upon me. It as simply a beautiful white flame; I met
                  [him](taylor) ; I had always been a reserved,
                  very retiring young girl, and he was the first man and the only man who
               ever embodied all the glories of manhood in one private body. He represented that to
               me. He never by look, by word or by deed gave me any reason to doubt any of my ideals
               that were placed in him absolutely. At the time our love first formulated he said to
               me, "Mary, this is not right. You are May and I am December, and this is not right. I
               know it is best that we must part." This was at the very beginning of it, and I said,
               "Of course, I don't want to do any immodest or bold thing; I couldn't try to withhold
               a person's love for me who didn't care for me."" I said, "I know that you are many
               years older than I, but I couldn't love anybody as I love you. I simply love you. And
               we did try to part, We tried it again and again, and then he would beoome ill. At one
               time I had almost resolved to see him no more, and he was taken ill and nobody else
               cared, [page 6] really cared whether he ate his dinner or
               whether he dressed warm1y enough, whether he took care of himself, and I couldn't
               bear for him to suffer. It was not only a love of sweetheart, but I wanted to be his
               nurse. I wanted to hold his head when it was aching. I wanted him to tell me his
               mental troubles, his heart troubles, and let me soothe them away for him as I would
               for a little child. I forgot the man's age; it meant nothing to me. The only thing I
               wanted was to serve him as I would have served the Lord or a little child, and then
               it just passed away; for months at a time I wouldn't see him and I didn't know why.
               Finally, I decided there was no use; it must come to an end and I went there on the
               night of the 23d to give him this letter telling him "goodbye." I had reason to
               believe, in the awful vernacular of the day, that it was over anyway, but I went
               there to say "goodbye" myself. He said, "It is rather late, isn't it, Mary?" when he
               opened the door. I said, "Yes, but don't you realize that I had to come to see you?
               You know Mama has been sick for three months and you have been ill and I have been
               frightfully worried and you haven't even had the kindness to call me to tell me that
               you were i11 and that I must not expect to see you to tell mo that things are all
               right." 

             I said, "I don't care if you don't wish to see me, because it hurts me, but it
               wouldn't have hurt one-millionth as much if you had just explained to me and not
               leave me in the dark." He said, "Mary, I couldn't help it; I couldn't help it and I
               can't explain it to you." Oh, I don't know! I have told this thing so many times, Mr
               Doran, that the words just - I can't tell it even as it is; I can't even express it
               to you as it really is. There is so much more to it.
             
            MR DORAN: At that time, on December 23d, let's see, he
               was killed on February 1st. Who was directing you then? 
            MINTER: Why, no one was. I had finished a picture.

             DORAN: Who directed the last one?
         
         
            # Interview with Mary Miles Minter
            *Jada Alvarez*

            STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT
               ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Section 2]

            MINTER: My last director was [Frank Urson](urson) . [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  so often, often made the remark to me that he
               wished tbat he were younger; he wanted to be younger. We undoubtedly would have been
               married today bnd he been younger. [He](taylor)  explained our
               not. being engaged in that way. I knew we never could be married; I also knew I never
               would love for another human being in the way I cared for him. So he would say, "You
               know, [Mary](minter) , to me you are the morning sun, bright,
               beaut1ful, and with the world and a futune before you, and I am the setting sun, and
               don't you see, my dear, it simply cannot be. I hope tbat doesn't give you the
               impression that I begged him to marry me. I never did in my life. I couldn't do that.
               I never even called him ["Billie"](taylor)  in my life. The
               man was too wonderful for that. He was wonderful. I don't care what anybody says or
               what they prove against him. I knew him as the finest thing in the world. 

             MR MOTT: [He](taylor)  as the embodyment of your ideal? 

            MINTER: Yes, and I can aay now that I can't truthfully -- I don't know any of those
               ugly things which have been aaid about him. I never found him so. He was glorious to
               me. 

             MR DORAN: I read in the paper where you had
               been engaged to some other man.

            MINTER: To [Mr Dickson](dickson) . That is not entirely
               true.

            DORAN: What is his first name?

             MINTER: [Thomas Dickson](dickson) .

            DORAN: Someone besides him, a director in the movies.

            MINTER: [Marshall Neilan](neilan) , engaged to him?

            DORAN: Yes, [Marshall Neilan](neilan) . Didn't I read in the
                  papers that you had been engaged to him
               and the engagement had been broken off? 

            MINTER: That is not true. [Mr Dickson](dickson)  is the only
               one to whom I have been even remotely engaged, and that was a freak of
               despondency.

            DORAN: What about [Marshall Neilan](neilan) ? Were you engaged
               to him?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Had you been going with [Marshall Neilan](neilan) 
               during, say the last thirty or sixty days prior to [Taylor's](taylor)  death?

            MINTER: Going with [him](taylor) ?

            DORAN: Had you been out anywhere with [him](taylor) ? 

            MINTER: Yes; he had been to see me; I had been out with [him](taylor) ; I am not sure whether it was within the thirty days
               or not, but in the last two months, yes sir; but going with him no more
               than I had for years off and on. [Mr Neilan's](neilan)  traits
               [page 9] are well known; he comes to see you, and we are always glad to receive him,
               but we never know how long he is going to stay with us or how long he was going to
               stay with this one or that one. He flits here and there like a swallow. We are all
               charmed with his personality, but don't take him seriously. 
            DORAN: Has [he](taylor)  proposed to you?

            MINTER: Must I answer that? Yes, he did.

            DORAN: Do you recall approximately when it was?

            MINTER: About two months ago.

            DORAN: That would take it to December 1st, approximately or in the
               middle of December?

            MINTER: Well, I think it was after that, Yes -- No, let me see, December
                  1st -- I wish I could tell you.

            DORAN: With reference to this December 23d that you called on [Taylor](taylor) , when was it?

            MINTER: It as before the 1st of December, I think.

            DORAN: Q. Before the 1st of December?

            MINTER: Yes; about the last of November. 

            DORAN: And you, of course, rejected im, I suppose?

            MINTER: Yes; that is, I didn't exactly say, "No, I will not marry you." I didn't take
               him seriously. I joked with [him](taylor)  at the time.

            DORAN: Did [he](taylor)  seem to be serious?

            MINTER: You never know. I couldn't say whether ee was serious or not. I thought
               possibly he was joking, or had a few cocktails.

            DORAN: How many times after that did [he](taylor)  mention the
               subject to you?

            MINTER: He didn't mention the subject. "May I marry you" again; he didn't say that,
               but he has been on very friendly terms with me and then suddenly go away to
                  San Francisco. and I wouldn't hear from him and
               I would remark, "Isn't that just like [Marshall?](neilan) "
               and thought no more of it. 
            DORAN: Well, but along toward the last thirty days prior to [Taylor's](taylor) 
               death, he seemed to be quite devoted to you, did
                  [he](taylor)  not?

            MINTER: No; I can't really say that he did. As for being with him, wasn't with
                  [him](taylor)  very much.

            DORAN: Didn't you observe in him some jealousy?

            MINTER: Oh, no; No, I can't say that. He was not jealous of me. He is the least
               jealous man I ever met. He takes life too much -- 
            DORAN: Did [he](taylor)  ever say anything to you about
                  [Taylor](taylor) ?

            MINTER: Yes, we have discussed him many times; he loved him. [Marshall Neilan](neilan)  loved [Mr Taylor](taylor) .

            DORAN: Did he ever bring any tales to you for which [Taylor](taylor)  was supposed to have been responsible!

            MINTER: Not until recently.

            DORAN: When was that?

            MINTER: Last Friday night; whereupon we had a severe quarrel. I didn't
               believe him.

            DORAN: Friday night
               after the killing?

            MINTER: Yes.

            DORAN: Or before the killing?

            MINTER: No; after.

            DORAN: Did he ever say anything like that to you before the killing?

            MINTER: No, indeed he did not; he knew that I loved [Mr
                  Taylor](taylor)  and he had known it.

            DORAN: Did he ever comment on that relation between you and [Taylor](taylor) ?

            MINTER: No, [he](taylor)  did not; I wouldn't have permitted
               him to; and I didn't comment on his.

            DORAN: I will use the word "quarrel," but that may be exaggerated; did you ever
                  quarrel with [Neilan](neilan)  over [Taylor](taylor) ? 
            MINTER: Absolutely not; absolutely not. [Marshall](neilan)  is
               the typification of the happy-go-lucky Irish spirit and temperaÂ­ment. [He](taylor)  does perfectly terrible things to everybody, but
               everybody loves him. They are always glad to see him again. As to harboring any
               deep-seated malice, I don't believe [he](taylor)  is capable
               of it. 
            DORAN: Could he have assumed at any time you and [he](taylor) , you and [Marshall Neilan](neilan)  -- I am
               speaking of [Marshall Neilan](neilan)  now -- Could he have
               assumed at any time that [he](taylor)  might be or was engaged
               to you by reason of your relations wtth him? 
            MINTER: Could [Marshall Neilan](neilan)  have assumed that
                  [Mr Taylor](taylor)  and I were engaged?

            DORAN: No, no; that you and [Marshall Neilan](neilan)  were
               enqaged?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Did you ever give [him](taylor)  the impression that he
               might some day be successful in his effort to marry you?

            MINTER: Not in my own knowledge. If I have, it was more or less of a joking way. I
               think I have at times said, "Well, [Marshall](neilan) , when
               are we going all around the world on our honey-moon?" exactly in the same manner as I
               took him to say, "Now, when you are my wedded bride we will do" so-andÂ­-so. [Marshall](neilan)  has done that time after time. 
            DORAN: Might he not have taken you seriously? 

            MINTER: I don't think so.

            DORAN: Do you know [he](taylor)  did not?

            MINTER: No, I don't know that [he](taylor)  did not.

            DORAN: Don't you know that [he](taylor)  was really -- Don't
               you feel that [he](taylor)  was really in love with you?

            MINTER: I can't truthfully answer "Yes" or "no" to that, beoause I don't know; I am
               not sure enough of [Mr Neilan's](neilan)  nature. While I have
               known him a great many years, well, I will say I have known him several
                  years, he is the type who flits back and forth, you know. - When you really
               think you know him he turns to something else, and I don't know, so I have never
               permitted myself to form any conclusions on his character; I don't know whether he
               has ever taken me seriously or not. I always treated [him](taylor)  more or less in a joking manner.

            # Interview With Mary Miles Minter
            *Lucy DiChristina*
             STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT
               ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Part 4] [Marshall](Marshall)  said that to me, and looked right at me. I
               could feel myself grow red. I said, "Is that all you have to tell me about [Mr Taylor](Taylor) ?" He said, "Well, I could recite some more
               instances about [Bill's](Taylor)  seeming insanity." He said,
               "I am certain he was insane. He stood up and told those things as soberly as I am talking to you now." 
             MR MOTT: Excuse me. Did he refer to [Mr Taylor's](Taylor) 
               physical condition? 
             MINTER: Yes, he said he was drunk at the time.
                  [Marshall](Marshall)  has told ma on several occasions,
               sometimes long ago and sometimes recently that he always hated to see [Bill](Taylor)  drink because he said, "You wouldn't know the man; he
               changes so; he gets maudlin and silly, smiles in a foolish manner and wobbles and
               talks, oh, just the silly, foolish things." He said, "None of his friends like to see
               him drink." At this time he was intoxicated and
               he talked on and on and on about this thing." [Marshall](Marshall)  said he got up and he told [
                  Bill](Taylor) , "You are insane; something 1s the matter with your mind. I would
               certainly take more vengeance on you if I didn't think you were crazy," and that was
               tbe opinion of [Arthur Hoyt](Arthur)  and [Cap Robinson](Robinson)  and everybody. They were perfectly amazed
               that a man of [Mr Taylor's](Taylor)  lovable, sweet,
               considerate, gentlemanly disposition all through life should suddenly turn around and
               say this about not only a woman, but about me, whom they all knew he admired and
               respected. 
             When I heard of this thing, l just looked to [Marshall](Marshall)  and said, "Is that all you have to tell me about [Mr Taylor](Taylor) ?" And he said, "Yes, that is all. That 1s the
               ghastly thing. I know you are going to hear this from somebody and I wanted you to
               hear it from me, and want to find out what you knew about the murder of this man." 
             By this time I was getting -- Oh, how can I can I express it? -- just exhausted with
               shock, one shock after another and of all the shocks I had received, this coming from
               hlm who I had no reason to doubt his word, I couldn't believe it; not as I knew
                  [Mr Taylor](Taylor) , I couldn't believe for an instant he
               had ever said these things to anybody, yet there [Marshall](Marshall)  giving me names, dates and places. The thing was too much for
               me. I got furious; and I said, "I don't believe you! I think you are lying! How dare
               you say this about him to me! I never want to see you again?" He got up and walked
               around the room for a minute and I was just broiling; I was just furious; and he
               turned around and he said, "Well, [Mary](Mary) , some day you
               will realize that I certainly am not saying this for any personal reason. It hurts me
               as it must hurt you. I am simply telling you because you are bound to know it; it is
               the truth and I wanted to be the one to tell you. 
             Well, I didn't have any more to say to him. I was just furious; I was furious with
               him; and finally he talked and he said, more, more, more personal things about, "You
               know [Mary](Mary)  that I care for you." 
             DORAN: He told you he loved you, did he? 
            MINTER: Yes; he did on Friday night. He said, "You know I
               care for you deeply." 
             I said, "I don't care; I don't want you to care for me; I don't want [John Jones](Jones)  to care for me or anybody; I don't want ever to
               be in love again as long as I live; I don't want to see any man; I hate men." I probably
               raved on. 
             I dont know what more I can tell you. I was so tired, exhausted; I had been sitting
               up all night. This conversation didn't come as quickly as I
               am te11ing it to you. It came with long pauses; he would get up and walk around with
               his cigarette smoking and come back again
               and go out and talk to the property man, go out of the office,
               and I would sit there alone and I tore a piece of paper, I was so tired, and
               suggested that we go home. I said, "Why keep
               sitting up? 
             You have got to get up at eight o'clock in the morning and it is nearly dawn."
               He aaid, "I am worried about this thing; I want to find out what you know about this
                  murder." Then it developed that [Marshall](Marshall)  thought I knew something about it, and he
               looked at me and he said, "Now, [Mary](Mary) " -- he got a
               little profane, he said, "Now, [Mary](Mary) , for God's sake,
               if you know anything about the murder of
                  [Bill](Taylor)  tell it to me now." He said, "Don't
               withhold anything." This was too much; not only had he been telling me these things
               about [Mr Taylor](Taylor) , but there he sat evidently
               believing that I knew someth1ng. I said, "Do you think that I killed
               [Mr Taylor](Taylor) ?" He said, "Oh, no; don't be silly. Now
               is no time to talk things like that. " He said, "I am just trying to find something
               out about this. This is going to be an awful affair." I said, "I didn't kill
               [William Desmond Taylor](Taylor)  and I don't know who
                  murdered him." He said, "You don't? You don't
               know anything?" He said, "Of course, you didn't kill him; of course, you didn't put anybody on to do it, But" he
               said, "don't you know somebody, don't you know some intiÂ­mate details that other
               people might not know? Can't you rack your brain and think who would have a motive
               for killing him?" 
             Then he sat there and we said words about pro and con, trying to think, and I
               thought over everyrody I knew and I said this, more or less in a humourous way, I
               said, "The only person I know who could have had a possible motive for killing him would be [Mrs. Julia
                  Crawford Ivers](Ivers) ." I was not serious when I said that. I was more or less
               humorous. She is a lady I feel I ought to explain about, who has never done me a
               wrong thing in her life and I have never done her a wrong thing, either, but she is a
                  Christian Science lady who has been associated
               with him as a scenario writer for many years; she is quite a trusted, lovely woman, I am sure; a very
               honorable respectable woman, but we don't like eaeh other. There is no reason, but we
               don't like each other. Every time I wanted to see him, somehow she would be there and
               she had a strange way of treating me. She would say, Oh yes, there is little
                  [Mary](Mary) . Here she comes." She would go on in this
               manner, "Oh, there is little [Mary](Mary)  again, Oh, there
               she is; wbat can she be want1ng this time? Oh, yes, uh huh." Quite a strange
               attitude, She just riled me. 
             DORAN: Bow old a woman was she? 
             MINTER: She must have been 50. Her son was [Mr
                  Taylor's](Taylor) 
               camera man. [Jimmy](Jimmy)  was my camera man, [Jim Vantrees](Jim) . I don't hate the woman, but she annoys me. She
               is one of the few people in the world I dislike to see. In fact, the irony of fate it
               was when I was in France after looking at the
               beautifUl Venus de Milo in Paris at the
                  Louvre, and after I had walked a few steps
               done a long hall, thinking of this excellent statue, who should I see but [Julia Crawford Ivers](Ivers) , a very, fat, large woman. She did
               some more of these Christian Science things, and
               she had a very unpleasant habit of whenever she would be with me and [Mr Taylor](Taylor) , she would always come and twit my chin. So I
               said, in really a joking manner -- I don't want to accuse the woman, because I don't
               think she had anything to do with the matter -- I said "I don't know anyone who would
               kill him but [Ju1ia Crawford Ivers](Ivers) ." "I always
               suspected the woman of being in love with him herself or she might have killed him tor that reason." He said, "My goodness! You
               mustn't say that out loud; somebody w111 believe you." I said, "I don't care if they
               do." I was in such a wild mood, Then, -- What else did we talk about? Oh! He talked
               about his productions and said, "I certainly
               have a terrible time, working day and night and a great deal depended upon Saturday
               and we must get certain work finished Friday." We talked
               of Friday
               night and that he had to get up at eight o'clock; he wasn't going to bed at all; that the boys were calling
               for him at eight o'clock, he said, and he knew if they
               didn't call he would never get up out of his slumbers. They were going somewhere on
                  location, I understood, possibly at the studio. He was just going home and
               take a shower, get a shave if he felt like it, and go on back and work some more. He said, "I am dog tired. I was never so exhausted,
               just dead." Finally I said, "Do you rea1ize this
               looks awful, being here all this time?" And he said, "I can't help it if it does. I
               had to tell you these things and wanted to find out what you knew about this case.
               That I know you knew [Bill](Taylor)  very well, probably
               better than any of us and" -- Oh, yes. He also asked me to tel1 him my feelings
               toward [Mr Taylor](Taylor) , exactly what everybody has been
               asking me, and I told him as I have been telling you, I loved him deeply, sincerely
               and absolutely; that I loved him truly, loved him in an all-around way, I cared for his health;
               his health came before my happiness and when he was ill -- and he didn't like to see
               anyone when he was ill-- my natural impulse was to
               go to him and be with him and sit up night after night with him, if necessary. l didn't do it; I didn t even
               attempt to, because he didn't want me to, and although I had sat in the dark, not
               knowing anything and worrying about it, I did that rather than intrude myself upon
               him when he didn't want me. 
             DORAN: What time of night dld you first meet -- What is
               this man's name? 
             MINTER: [Mr Neilan](Neilan) ? 
             DORAN: [Mr Neilan](Neilan) , this particular night. 
             MINTER: We went down to the Salt Lake station
               after one. 
             DORAN: And you arrived at your home, was it, or
               his home or whose home was it where you were frying the eggs? 
             MINTER: His home, Friday
               night; it was really Saturday
               morning, wasn't it? I call lt Friday
               night, because it was still nighttime. The five of us arrived there, oh, I don't know, he didn't
               finish work until between two-thirty and three o'c1ock, maybe after three; I didn't have a
                  watch at that time. 
             DORAN: Row long approximatey do you suppose you spent talking in the studio? 
             MINTER: Now, let me see, we stayed at [Marshall's](Marshall) 
               house wtth the eggs and things at least an hour, maybe two hours; I am not
               certain of that at all; I don't think much more than an hour. Then we went right on to the studio, 
             DORAN: Do you suppose you spent a couple of hours down
               there? 
             MINTER: I think maybe we spent a couple of hours; maybe
                  three hours; it takes a good while to go from Salt Lake station up to [Marshall's](Marshall) 
               home on Sunset
                  Boulevard. It would take at least forty-five
                  minutes, I think. Then it takes some time to go from his home to the studio,
               way out on Santa Monica Boulevard. 
             DORAN: Where was the studio? 
             MINTER: On Santa Monica Boulevard, the
                  Hollyood Studios. 
             DORAN: Did you suggest that you go down there with him? 
             MINTER: He said, "Let's go on down" -- No, the first thing he said was "Let's get
               out of here. I am burning up alive." It was very cold when we came in the house and we put on steam and then he got terribly hot. I
               don't know what was the matter with me, I wouldn't take off my coat. He said, "If you are going to stay there and
               burn, let's go out and talk." We got in the car
               and drove around for a while. No, it is not a fact that he said in the house, "We must go to the studio and talk." I think I said that at first; it is not so. He
               said, "Let's go out and talk." Then it was very bitterly cold outside, freez1ng ocld. 
             DORAN: You left the rest of the party at the house? 
             MINTER: No; [Miss Swanson](Swanson)  and [Mr Pickford](Pickford)  got in [Mr
                  Pickford's](Pickford) 
               Locomobile and he said he ms going to take her
                  home. She was very anxious to get to bed as she had to get up early and work. 
             DORAN: Then, you and [Marshall Neilan](Marshall) 
               drove around awhile and
               finally wound up in the studio? 
             MINTER: Yes; we drove around, went out
                  Sunset Boulevard and went up -- We went
               along Hollywood Boulevard for a while, 
             DORAN: What did you discuss while you were riding around in the machine? 
             MINTER: Why, about this thing about[ Mr Taylor](Taylor)  and
               then also I was rather peeved na [Marshall](Marshall)  at the
               time because I hadn't heard from him in weeks. "Peeved" is hardly the word. That
               sounds more as if I am interested in [Marshall](Marshall) ,
               and I am; I like him, but l wasn't caring particularly; I simply said, "Well,
                  [Marshall](Marshall) , it was not a very nice thing the way
               you ran off the last time. I understood they were going out to dinner and you were coming to my house to dinner and suddenly you
               went to San Francisco without so much as a
               fare-thee-well."' He said, "You know I do those things." I said, "Yes, you do those
               things, and it ts very annoying, but your friends love you and love you yet in spite
               of those funny little tricks you do, darting here and there. I don't know, I am in no
               mood to take thia foolishness; I want good wholesome friendship, but I want to know
               when you are going to appear." Many times a whole dinner has gotten cold waiting for him. When we had a dinner party at our house, or other people have given parties, they have waited on [Marshall](Marshall)  for two or three hours and he
               finally would come along smiling sweetly at everybody and they couldn't scold him. I
               was more or less taking him to task for his 1ife in general, saying he should not do
               those things; it was very annoying and I was not going to put up with it. He was
               sweet and Irish and said, "You wouldn't be angry with me?" And I said, "No, I
               wouldn't be." That is the way we got out of that. There was nothing serious in the
               talk, Just the way we always talked. 
             DORAN: Then you finally went to the studio? 
             MINTER: Finally he said, "Now, I have got something very important to tell you,
               something that is going to hurt your feelings terribly, but I must tell you; we wi11
               go in the studio and talk." Our teeth were
               chatter1ng with cold and we went in there and he turned on the steam and I sat in
               this fur coat in a wicker chair, and he said, "This is going to b, a nine or
               "nineteen-days talk of the world" Then he told me all the things I have been telling
               you. There may have been some more, and some thlngs I have said may not be exactly
               accurate, but the gist of the thing is entirely accurate. 
             DORAN: Did he declare his love for you, whi1e
               rid1ng around in the machine? 
             MINTER: No, he did not. 
             DORAN: Not until you reached the studio did he
               do tha that? 
             MINTER: Not until after we had been there a long time at the studio. 
             DORAN: Was it before or after he told you about this instance in connection with
                  [Taylor](Taylor)  -- 
             MINTER: It was afterwards. I don't know yet whether he really meant it; maybe he was
               as sincere as he could be, and he can be very sincere, I am sure. I am sure he can.

            STATEMENT OF [MISS MARY MILES MINTER](minter) . [G.H BOONE](boone)  OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
               OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Part 5]

            DORAN: This was the second time that [he](neilan)  had
               declared love for you. On one occasion [he](neilan)  proposed
               to [you](minter) ?

            MINTER: Yes.

            DORAN: [He](neilan)  asked [you](minter)  to marry [him](neilan) ?

            MINTER: Yes, and then [he](neilan)  would dart away again. I
               mean [he](neilan)  would call me up -- [He](neilan)  can't call me up, because I have no telephone; [he](neilan)  would send me flowers, too, and suddenly I would not hear from [him](neilan)  for two or three weeks. As I said to
                  [him](neilan)  in the car, not particularly about that but about other things, about
                  dinner engagements, about appointments, I said,
               "You know, [Marshall](neilan) , I never know when l am going
               to see [you](neilan)  and when I am not going to see [you](neilan) , and just what [you](neilan) 
               are going to do, and I am in no mood to go on like that at all; I don't care much
               about it."

            DORAN: When did [you](minter)  tell [him](neilan)  that?

            MINTER: I told [him](neilan)  that when [we](minterneilan)  were driving the car.

            DORAN: How old a [man](neilan)  is [Marshall Neilan](neilan) ?

            MINTER: Just thirty.

            DORAN: Has [he](neilan)  ever been married?

            MINTER: Yes, [he](neilan)  has been married once for a
                  few days. [He](neilan)  remained married to
                  [his wife](neilanwife)  for a long time, for seven
                  years, I think, but [he](neilan)  was actually only
               married a few days. I think [he](neilan)  married when
                  [he](neilan)  was twenty or nineteen.

            DORAN: Have [you](minter)  seen [him](neilan)  since this Friday night?

            MINTER: No, I have not.

            DORAN: Have you talked with [him](neilan)  over the
                  telephone?

            MINTER: It was really Saturday morning.

            DORAN: Has [he](neilan)  called you up on the telephone?

            MINTER: No; [he](neilan)  may have called me at the New Hampshire house and I wouldn't know.

            DORAN: [You](minter)  haven't talked with [him](neilan)  over the telephone?

            MINTER: I haven't seen [him](neilan)  or talked to [him](neilan)  or come in touch with [him](neilan)  in any way

            DORAN: You haven't received any letters from
                  [him](neilan) ?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Did you part friendly or unfriendly?

            MINTER: [We](minterneilan)  did part more or less friendly, as
               I always did with [Marshall](neilan) , no matter how angry I
               would become with [him](neilan) , somehow you can't bear
               malice against that [boy](neilan) .

            DORAN: [You](minter)  have become angry with [him](neilan)  on other occasions?

            MINTER: Yes. This night for the time being, I was furious [missing page] [...]
                  [Mr Neilan](neilan)  -- [Taylor's](taylor) , and at the time of [Mr
                  Taylor](taylor) 's death, [Harry](harry)  was the assistant director in [Mr Taylor's](taylor) 
               companies there, and he had said [Harry](harry)  had been in the
                  room looking over the effects -- Just a minute. I wonder if [Charles Maigne](maigne)  told me this. I think [Mr Neilan](neilan)  told me this, too, that [Harry](harry)  bad gotten the letters
               and taken them to [Jim Vantrees](vantrees) , [the camera man](vantrees) ,
               whereupon I remarked, "I will bet [Mrs Ivers](ivers)  had
               them," and I think [he](vantrees)  said, "[Jim](jim)  gave them to [Mr Eyton](eyton) ," and that [Mr
                  Eyton](eyton)  turned some of them over
               to the [Examiner](examiner) . I am so afraid l am telling
               things that are not so here, [Mr Doran](doran) ; I don't mean
               to, but I couldn't get all of it. That is as clear as I can make it. Anyway, I do
               remember this part, [he](eyton)  said [he](eyton)  heard about them, and I
               don't know how [he](eyton)  heard about them, and that [he](eyton) 
               went down, I believe, to the [Examiner](examiner) , to get
               ahold of them and [he](eyton)  had something to do with Pasadena, a man, he did tell me the man's name.
               I don't remember his name, but I believe it beÂ­gan with "S", and
               this [man](neilan) , [Marshall](neilan)  said he was the [big man](neilan) 
               over the entire Examiner force, told [him](neilan)  to go down and take the letters. [He](neilan)  said, "Of course, if
                  [you](minter)  breathe this it wi11 just about throw
                  [me](neilan)  in jail for the rest of [my](neilan)  life," but I don't believe it will. Then [he](neilan)  said, "Didn't [you](minter)  get
                  them today?" I said, "[I](minter)  did not." As well as I remember, [Marshall](neilan)  said, "I then sent them to the Realart Studio and
               they ought to be in [Charley](charley) 's hands now or
                  [Mr Garbut](garbut) ." This whole Friday night
               is most hasy in my recollection.

            DORAN: This [man](neilan)  knew before [you](minter)  were in love with [Mr Taylor](taylor) ?

            MINTER: Oh, yes.

            DORAN: [You](minter)  had told [him](neilan)  that, had [you](minter)  not?

            MINTER: No; in fact, I had never said to [Marshall](neilan) 
                  "[I](minter)  am in love with [William Desmond Taylor](taylor) ." I never had.

            DORAN: How did [he](neilan)  find it out, then?

            MINTER: [He](neilan)  knew about it, because [we](mintertaylor)  had been friends a long time. Before this
                  [Marshall](neilan)  had come to my house very despondent and said, "I think [I](neilan)  will go out in the garden
               and eat wooly worms." I said, "Don't feel that way; there are plenty of us who feel
               the same way." I am certain [he](neilan)  knew about
                  this thing. I made no secret of
                  it, but I didn't promenade it
               about.

            DORAN: Don't [you](minter)  have a recollection of having told
                  [him](neilan) , [Marshall
                  Neilan](neilan) , that you were fond of [Taylor](taylor) ?

            MINTER: No. Many times I said, "I admire [Mr Taylor](taylor) ;
               I respect [him](taylor) ; [you](neilan)  know I respect his opinion; what a [wonderful man](taylor)  I consider [him](taylor)  to be."
                  [He](neilan)  knew I regarded [him](taylor)  most highly.

            DORAN: Do you remember if [he](neilan)  asked you at the time
                  [he](neilan) 
               proÂ­posed to you if you were in love with any one
               else?

            MINTER: No, [he](neilan)  didn't ask me that at all.

            DORAN: Did you have any admirers who might have been jealous of [him](neilan) ?

            MINTER: There was only one possible [admirer](dickson) , and
               that was [Mr Dickson](dickson) .

            DORAN: Any besides [Mr Dickson](dickson) ?

            MINTER: No; in fact, if I may say so, neither [Mr
                  Dickson](dickson)  nor [Mr Neilan](neilan)  has been with
               me constantly enough, or I feel really care enough for me to do any such thing in my
               behalf, I mean such as commit murder. In my own
               mind I am absolutely convinced that I know they would not.

            DORAN: [You](minter)  think they are incapable, in other
               words?

            MINTER: I absolutely do.

            DORAN: What kind of cigarettes was [Neilan](neilan)  smoking the night at the studio?

            MINTER: [He](neilan)  smokes two kinds of cigarettes. [He](neilan) 
               smokes a gold tipped called "Dimi"
               something from Egypt, I forget the name,
                  "D" something; I noticed it comes from Cairo; then [he](neilan)  smokes Chesterfield cigarettes. At least, I have seen
                  [him](neilan)  smoking Chesterfield cigarettes. I remember that much, because I have always
               admired the face of the Chesterfield
                  boy on that red back
                  sign, you know, that laughing
                  boy in the light hair that says, "Gee"! They satisfy!"

            DORAN: Did [Neilan](neilan)  take [you](minter)  home then that morning from the studio or did [you](minter)  go
               back in your own car?

            MINTER: No; my car had been driven back to
               its garage by [Mr
                  Neilan's chauffeur](neilanchauffeur)  with my [friend](scarborough) 
               [Mr Scarborough](scarborough)  in it. Poor [Mr Scarborough](scarborough)  had been driving around with me
                  all evening. I hadn't been able to sleep and that was why I ws_ out.
                  [He](scarborough)  said if I didn't mind [he](scarborough)  would just go on back home, now that I was in safe
               hands, and get some sleep. [He](scarborough)  was pretty near
               dead tired. [He](scarborough)  isn't a very strong man.

            DORAN: So [Neilan](neilan)  took [you](minter) 
               home then

            MINTER: Yes; right straight home.

            DORAN: Did [he](neilan)  ask you to keep in confidence the
                  conversation
               you had had with [him](neilan) ? Did
                  [he](neilan)  tell you not to say anything about it?

            MINTER: l don't remember [him](neilan)  saying to me, "You
               must keep this all in secret oonfidenoe"; no, I do not, because when [we](minterneilan)  got home
               we discussed some of the things with [mother](cshelby) , with
               the whole family, in fact; [he](neilan)  discussed the
               seriousness of the conversation and told
               me not to do anything without my [atÂ­torneys](legal) .

            DORAN: [He](neilan)  told you that?

            MINTER: Yes; [he](neilan)  said, "You
               mustn't make any move without your [attorneys](legal) ."
                  [He](neilan)  spoke of [Mr
                  Mott](mott)  and said [Mr Mott](mott)  was very able and
               that [he](mott)  would tell me the right thing to do and not
               to make a move without [him](neilan) .

            DORAN: Did [you](minter)  comment on [his](neilan)  concern?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Did [you](minter)  say anything to [him](neilan) , for instance to this effect: "Why should [you](neilan)  be so concerned about [me](minter) ? Why should [I](minter)  consult [attorneys](legal)  in connection with this
                  affair?" or anything like that?

            MINTER: No, I did not, because at the time, when I asked [him](neilan)  if [he](neilan)  suspected me of killing
               Mr Taylor, we had that out; [he](neilan) 
               assured me [he](neilan)  didn't suspect any such thing, but
                  [he](neilan)  was very much impressed with the gravity of
               the situation. In fact, evidently [he](neilan)  knew at that
               time exactly how these things were going to turn out. I mean that they would drag
               everybody's name into it; that the papers could
               get hold of for the notoriety of it. [He](neilan)  said, "This
               involves picture people and you know how [Hearst](hearst)  hates the picture
                  people. [Hearst](hearst)  would do anything
                  [he](hearst)  could if [he](hearst) 
               thought you did know [Mr Taylor](taylor) ," "There are lots of
               prominent people in the profession who knew [him](taylor)  and loved [him](taylor) . They
               are certainly going to drag your name into it."

            DORAN: [You](minter)  didn't telephone
               [Taylor](taylor)  on the night he was
                  murdered?

            MINTER: No.

            DORAN: Where did [you](minter)  happen to be that night?

            MINTER: I was at home reading the Cruise of the
                  Kewa. It is a humorous
               book; it is really a travesty of Frederick
                  O'Brien's stories of the South Seas. It is very funny, and I laid
               there laughing all the evening. I was very -- right while I was laying
               on the couch reading aloud to [mother](cshelby)  and sister and we were all laughing heartily at
               that time, and at the same time [Mr Taylor](taylor)  was
                  being murdered. It seems very horrible to
               me.

            DORAN: [You](minter)  had no company at home
               that night?

            MINTER: Let me see. I don't remember any. Possibly [Mr
                  Stockdale](stockdale) , he generally did, or maybe somebody dropped in. I don't just
               remember. Usually every evening somebody drops in. I know they were not there at the
               time I was reading the book.

            DORAN: Your automobiles were all home?

            MINTER: Yes, unless I put my car in the
                  garage called the Standard Garage. I leave it there sometimes, the Standard Garage on Hollywood
                  Boulevard and Western Avenue. Sometimes when my girl friends stop with
               me and have [her](minterfriend) 
               car, I would move out and put it in this
                  garage and maybe wouldn't call for it for
                  several days. I haven't been feeling well for some time; I have had
               bronchitis. I hadn't gotten well when this awful shock came to me, and I haven't used
               the little car very much.

            DORAN: Do you have a [chauffeur](chaucy) ?

            MINTER: Yes; faithful old [Chauncy](chaucy) . [Chauncy](chaucy)  is just as concerned about this thing as [my mother](cshelby)  is.

            DORAN: Well, I don't think of anything else I care to inquire about now.

            MINTER: [Mr Doran](doran) , if I can be of any possible help
               in any way, it is true I don't know any more than I have told you; if I can, please
               call on me the first thing, won't you?

            DORAN: Thank you, very much. You may think of little things of which you may not
               appreciate the imporance, [Mr Mott](mott) .

            MINTER: As I told [Mr Mott](mott)  today, I remember saying to
                  [Mr Mott](mott) , "I am so tired I am like a little child.
               I speak words mechanically. I sit, sleep, get up, walk and dress, and I don't see
               exactly what I am doing."
         
         
            # Interview with Antonio Moreno
            *Colin Caricato*

            February 5, 1922
               LOS ANGELES EXAMINER
               Victim Happy Before Death
               [Antonio Moreno](moreno)  Tells of Phone Conversation With Him
                     at 7 o'clock Night of Tragedy

            The assassination of [William Desmond Taylor](taylor) , Wednesday night,
               postponed forever an engagement which the film
               director had with [Antonio Moreno](moreno) , film star, on
                     Thursday morning. When [Moreno](moreno)  talked with [Taylor](taylor)  over the
                  telephone
               Wednesday night, about 7 o'clock, [Taylor](Taylor)  was in the best of spirits, according to [Moreno's](moreno)  story told yesterday.
            But when the time came for the appointment to
               be fulfilled the following morning, between 10 and 10:30
                  o'clock, the film director's corpse lay in a local undertaking
                  company's morgue, pierced by a murderer's
                  bullet. [Moreno](moreno)  said
                  yesterday that he had been an intimate friend of [Taylor](taylor)  for several years, since the time
                  [Taylor](taylor)  had become associated with the old Vitagraph Company at Santa
                  Monica in 1914.
            "He was one of the finest men I ever met," "[Tony](moreno) "
               said. "He had the highest ideals, I believe, of any man I've ever met in the
               profession." Details of a dinner party which he
               attended with [Taylor](taylor) , [Miss
                  Betty Francisco](betty)  and [Miss Claire
                  Windsor](windsor) , at the Ambassador Hotel
               Thursday night, January 27, were given by [Moreno](moreno) , as well as an informal
                  meeting held between [Moreno](moreno) ,
                  [Taylor](taylor) , [Arthur
                  Hoyt](hoyt)  and [a Captain Robinson](robinson)  [sic],
                  January 28, at [Moreno's](moreno) 
               room at the Los Angeles Athletic Club.
            "I left them there about 7 o'clock," [Moreno](moreno)  said, "to go to a dinner
                  party at the Ambassador, which I
               had arranged for [a friend](relationship)  visiting here from
                  Chicago. Later, I understand, the three went to
                  dinner at a roadhouse between Los Angeles and Pasadena--I do not know its name--and then
               on to the Annandale Club
               after dinner, finally going to
                  [Taylor's](taylor) 
               home."
            [Moreno](moreno)  declared he had spent about two
                     hours last Monday with [Taylor](taylor) 
               at the Vitagraph studio, where [Moreno](moreno)  is working. He had an appointment with him for Tuesday, also, but the
               director, according to [Moreno](moreno) , did not fill it
               because of a trip to Mount Lowe on location.
            "Then I called him again Wednesday night," [Moreno](moreno)  said, "about 6 o'clock. His boy,
                  [Henry](henry) , answered the phone. [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was not
                  at home. However, he called me later,
                  about 7, and we arranged that I should call for [Mr. Taylor](taylor) , at the Lasky
                  studio, about 10 o'clock Thursday morning.
                  [Mr. Hoyt](hoyt)  was with me in my
                  room at the time. [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was to
               go with me to the Vitagraph studio, on a matter
               of personal business."
            "But--" and here [Moreno](moreno)  gave a sorrowful shake of
               his head--"But you know the rest. The appointment was not fulfilled--and never will be. "I feel that in
                  [Mr. Taylor's](taylor) 
               death I've lost one of the best friends I've
               ever know. And I'll do everything in my power to run down [the man who killed him](perpatrator) ."

               Director Was Healthy and Cheerful, Says Friend
               Check on Events of Week Taken by [Officers](enforcement) 

            [William D. Taylor](taylor)  appeared to be in the best of
               health and spirits about one hour before he was shot down in his own
                  apartment at 404-B South Alvarado Street. He did not appear to have any
               premonition of what lay in store for him, although, according to the [police](law)  theory of the slaying of the film director, the
                  [murderer](perpatrator)  was then lurking in the shadows a
               few feet away from [Mr. Taylor](taylor) .
            This was disclosed yesterday by [Tony Moreno](moreno) ,
                  Vitagraph star. [Mr.
                  Moreno's](moreno)  story of his conversations with the slain director on the night of the murder and for a week
                  prior to the shooting, furnish an important check on [Mr. Taylor's](taylor)  movement for at least seven days preceding the
                  shooting. "I played golf with
                  [Mr. Taylor](taylor) 
               exactly a week before his death.
               We drove to the San Gabriel Country Club and
               remained there from about noon till dark. While there I introduced him
               to [Asa Keyes, the Deputy District Attorney](keyes) ."
                  [Mr. Moreno](moreno)  said yesterday at his apartment, in the Los Angeles
                  Athletic Club.
            "The next day I saw him again. I met him at the
                  Ambassador at a party. [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was with [Miss Claire
                  Windsor](windsor) . I saw him leave the hotel
               with her. There were a number of picture people there that night.
                     "Saturday night--that is, a week ago
                     tonight--[Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was here
                  in the club. He was in my room and with us were [Arthur
                  Hoyt](hoyt)  and [Capt. Robertson](robertson) , who is a
               close friend of [Mr. Taylor](taylor) . We sat and talked a
               while. Then [Mr. Taylor](taylor) , [Mr.
                  Hoyt](hoyt)  and [Capt. Robertson](robertson)  left.
               Later I learned they drove to Cedar Grove, near Pasadena, and had something to eat there.
               From there they drove to the Annandale Country
                  Club.
            "I saw [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  next at the Lasky studios, Monday morning
               at 10 o'clock. I had an appointment with him to go to the Vitagraph
                  studios, on a matter of business importance to me. [Chester Bennett](bennett)  of the Brunton
                  studios, was with us. We were together until 12:30 p.m. that
                  day. "We were unable to see the people we wanted that day. The appointment had to be made over again. I called
                  [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  again, Tuesday at the
                  Lasky lot, but I did not get to talk to him. I
               was informed that he was out on location on Mt.
                  Lowe. Tuesday, which was the day before the murder, I
               could not get in touch with him.
            "Wednesday night
               [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  called me at the
                  club. I was in [Mr. Hoyt's](hoyt) 
               room, when the call came. We discussed the
                  business appointment I wanted [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  to participate in. As near as I can now recall
               it, it was about 7 o'clock when [Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor)  called. He did not tell me much about his trip to Mt. Lowe.
            "[Mr. Hoyt](hoyt)  was present at the conversation. It lasted
                  several minutes. [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  then
               made an appointment for Thursday
                     morning, at 10 o'clock. He appeared to be in best of spirits. He
               was pleasant and cheerful. "It was a few minutes after 7 that [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  hung up. Then [Mr.
                  Hoyt](hoyt)  and I went to the club
                  dining-room and stayed there for dinner. "Thursday morning, [Mr. Hoyt](hoyt)  called me and told me I would not be able to keep
               the appointment with [Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor)  because he was dead. He then told me what he read in the
               papers."
            [The investigators](enforcement) 
               last night began to check up the facts supplied by [Mr. Moreno](moreno)  in an effort to supply the missing links and
               thus account for every action and movement of the [slain
                  director](director) . [Mr. Moreno's](moreno)  story supplied
               much important data, the [officers](enforcement)  say.

            Coroner's Inquest Transcript

            The following is the transcript of the
               shorthand notes taken at [the Coroner's](coroner)  inquest held on the body of [William Desmond Taylor](taylor)  at
                  Ivy H. Overholtzer [Mortuary] at Los Angeles, California on the 4th day of February,
                  1922 at 10:00 a.m.

            CHARLES EYTON: NANCE, [Coroner Charles Eyton](eyton) , being
               first duly sworn, testified as follows:

            BY THE CORONER:

            NANCE: Please state your name.

            EYTON: [Charles Eyton](eyton) .

            NANCE: Where do you reside?

            EYTON: 1920 Vine Street, Hollywood.

            NANCE: What is your occupation?

            EYTON: General Manager, Famous Players-Lasky
                  Corporation.

            NANCE: [Mr. Eyton](eyton) , have you seen the remains of the deceased in the adjoining room?

            EYTON: Yes, sir.

            NANCE: Do you recognize them as one you knew in life?

            EYTON: Yes, sir.

            NANCE: Who was it.

            EYTON: [William Desmond Taylor](taylor) .

            NANCE: Where was he born?

            EYTON: He was born in Ireland, to the best of
               my knowledge. He told me so.

            NANCE: What was his age?

            EYTON: Forty-four, I should judge. [He was forty-nine.]

            NANCE: Was he married, single or a widower?

            EYTON: He was married. [He was divorced as of 1916.]

            NANCE: When did he die?

            EYTON: Thursday morning or Wednesday night. I saw the
                  body first on Thursday
               morning.

            NANCE: Last Thursday?

            EYTON: Yes, sir.

            NANCE: Do you recall that date?

            EYTON: It was the 2nd.

            NANCE: February 2nd?

            EYTON: February 2nd.

            NANCE: Where did he die?

            EYTON: EYTON: the EYTON: Apartment "B," South Alvarado
                  Street, 404 I think it was.

            NANCE: What was the cause of his death, if you know?

            EYTON: Well, [Mr. Taylor's](taylor)  assistant [[Harry Fellows]](harryFellows)  rang me up at my residence about, I
               should judge, eight o'clock, and told me [Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor)  had died suddenly; so I immediately went over to his residence,
               and he was lying on the floor on his
                  back. [Detective
                  Ziegler](ziegler)  was there and he had called the doctor, he told me, previous to
               my arrival; and the doctor told me [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  had
               died from hemorrhage of the stomach.
                  [Mr. Maclean - Douglas Maclean](dougMaclean)  - had told me
               that he had thought he had heard a shot
               the night before, and his wife also thought she had heard a shot - and he wanted the body turned over; they didn't want to turn it over until the coroner
               came. The [deputy coroner](coroner)  came after a while, and
               he told us he had died of hemorrhage of the stomach, and I told him he had better turn the body over to make sure, and he put his hand under [Mr.
                  Taylor's](taylor) 
               body, and found a little - when he pulled his
                  hand out, it had a little blood on his hand. [Douglas](dougMaclean)  asked him what
               that was, and he said it evidently had run down from his [[Taylor's]](taylor) 
               mouth, but I noticed that there was no
                  trail of blood-[Mr.
                  Taylor's](taylor) 
               head was in a pool of blood - there was no trail of
                  blood running down. 

            NANCE: There was a pool of blood under his
                  head?

            EYTON: Under his head, yes, a little
                  pool of blood. I immediately opened up
                  [Mr. Taylor's](taylor) 
               vest, and looked, and looked on the
               right-hand side, and there was no mark. I looked on the left-hand side and saw some
                  blood, and then I told the [Deputy Coroner](coroner)  that I thought that evidence enough to
               turn his body over to see what would happen. I
               sent for a pillow to put under [Mr. Taylor's](taylor) 
               head, and we turned him over - the [Deputy Coroner](coroner)  and myself - and we pulled his shirt and his vest up, and we found the bullet
                  wound. 

            NANCE: [Mr. Eyton](eyton) , was his body stone cold at that time?

            EYTON: Stone cold and very stiff and rigid.

            NANCE: Indicating that it had been dead for some time?

            EYTON: Yes.

            NANCE: Where was the body lying with reference
               to the front entrance to his home?

            EYTON: It was lying right in front of a little desk with the head pointed
               east and the feet pointed west. I should judge the feet were three or four feet from the door - the front entrance.

            NANCE: Who were present when you was there?

            EYTON: When I came in, the first man I noticed was [Detective
                  Ziegler](ziegler) , whom I have known for a number of years, and [Douglas Maclean](dougMaclean) ; [Charles
                  Maigne](maigne) ; the landlord [[E. C.
                  Jessurun]](jessurun) ; and [Harry Fellows](harryFellows) ,
                  [Mr. Taylor's](taylor)  assistant director.

            NANCE: Did all of these persons live there in this neighborhood?

            EYTON: That I could not tell you. [Mr. MacLean](dougMaclean) 
               did, I know, because he showed me where his apartment was.

            NANCE: The place [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  lived was in a
                  court?

            EYTON: In a court, yes.

            NANCE: These other buildings were
               nearby?

            EYTON: There are several apartments in this
                  court, all the way around.

            NANCE: Did Mr. and Mrs. MacLean, or either of
               them, tell you about the hour that they heard the gunshot?

            EYTON: Yes, [Mr. Maclean](dougMaclean)  told me it was
                  about eight or a quarter after eight, and [Mrs. Maclean](faithMaclean)  thought it was a little
                  later. [This is not correct.]

            NANCE: That night?

            EYTON: Yes, the night before.

            NANCE: You didn't make any definite measurements as to the position of the
                  body?

            EYTON: No, sir.

            NANCE: So that what you testified to is only an estimate, and nothing definite about
               it.

            EYTON: Yes.

            NANCE: Now, how long has [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  lived in this
               place?

            EYTON: That I could not tell you. He lived in it before he went to the war, I believe.

            NANCE: When did you last see him alive?

            EYTON: The same day - Wednesday.

            NANCE: Now, did he have any fire-arms of his
               own?

            EYTON: I believe he had a revolver; I believe the
                  revolver was in the upper drawer
               upstairs; in fact, I know there was, because
                  [Detective Ziegler](ziegler)  and myself went up there and
               saw it.

            NANCE: When you were called to this place, did you see any fire-arms in this room where he
               was?

            EYTON: No.

            NANCE: What is the name of his valet, or attendant there?

            EYTON: [Harry Peavey](peavey) , the colored cook. I never knew
               him or saw him.

            NANCE: Was he the one who called you?

            EYTON: [Harry Fellows](harryFellows) , his assistant director,
               was the one who called me.

            NANCE: You have no independent knowledge of the manner in which he met his death?

            EYTON: No, sire.

            [THE CORONER](coroner) : Have you any questions,
               gentlemen?

            NANCE: (By [a Juror](juror) ) Was his clothing ruffled in any way, showing any
               violence?

            EYTON: No, absolutely none; it looked like he just walked in the door and was shot in the back; that is the way it looked. It didn't show evidence in the
                  room when I got there- neither the room or the body
               showed any evidence of a struggle. He had on the same suit as when I seen him the day before when he talked
               to me.

            [THE CORONER](coroner) : Is there any other questions? That is
               all, you may be excused.

            NANCE: When you went out, which way did you go out, at the
                  front or the back?

            PEAVEY: I went out the front way. I always lock
               up the back door when I go out. I always lock
               the back door screen; it has a hook on the inside. I used the front door to come out all the time.

            NANCE: Did you carry the back door key with
               you?

            PEAVEY: No, sir. I always turn it in the door
               and leave it just as it is.

            NANCE: Now, when did you next see [Mr. Taylor](taylor) ?

            PEAVEY: The next morning, when I went to work.

            PEAVEY. I picked up the paper first; I stopped in a drug store at the corner of 5th and Los Angeles to get a bottle of medicine - milk
                  of magnesia, [he](taylor)  usually takes that
               every morning; I bought that on my way out.
                  I picked up the paper and unlocked the door.
               The first thing I saw was his feet. I looked at his feet a few minutes and
                  said, "[Mr. Taylor](taylor) ." [He](taylor)  never moved. I stepped a little further in the
                     door, and seen his face, and turned and ran out and hollered.

            NANCE: Who did you summon? Who did you call to?

            NANCE: You mean [Mr. Jessurun](jessurun) ?

            PEAVEY: Yes, sir.

            NANCE: Who else came?

               gentlemens next door, [Mr. MacLean](dougMaclean)  and Mr. - I
               can't think of the other gentleman's name - right next door to us [[Charles Maigne]](maigne) .

            NANCE: You didn't come back there after you had gone away, when [Miss Normand](normand)  was there with [Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor) ?

            NANCE: When you went out, was anybody around the
                  place? 

            PEAVEY: Only [Miss Normand's chauffeur](normand) ; he had his
                  lights all on inside the limousine, cleaning it. I hit
                  him on the back and stopped and talked to him a few
                  minutes.

            NANCE: When you first opened the door, did you see any furniture
               overturned, or any sign of a disturbance in the house?

            PEAVEY: Nothing more than a chair that was
               sitting next to the wall had been pushed out a little bit and his feet was under this chair. The rest of the furniture around the house
               and room upstairs was just as I left them when I
               went away that evening.

            NANCE: And did you notice whether anything had been taken off of his body, or not - any jewelry?

            PEAVEY: I didn't notice that; I didn't touch him at all.

             NANCE: Do you know whether he wore any valuable jewelry?

            PEAVEY: Yes sir, he had a wrist watch and
                  another watch with a lot of little
               trinkets on; and a thing you stamp
                  checks with to keep anybody from making the
                  checks any big- ger, and a lead pencil.

            NANCE: Did he have a diamond ring?

            PEAVEY: Yes sir, he had a large diamond
                  ring that he wore.

            NANCE: Do you know whether he had it on that evening?,

            PEAVEY: Yes sir, he was dressed just as when I went that evening, as I
               found him the next morning.

            NANCE: Was the ring on his finger the next morning?

            PEAVEY: Yes sir, his other jewelry that I
               had put away the night before was just as I had put it away up in the
                  dresser drawer.

            NANCE: You didn't find anything taken from the apartment?

            PEAVEY: No sir, it was just as when I left it when I found it. The rug was a little bit kicked up. It looked like he
               had kicked it with his foot.

            NANCE: There was no other disturbance there?

            PEAVEY: No, sir. Even the living-room
               table that I had moved aside. The
                  rocking chair would hit the table, and I moved the table so the rocking chair
               would not hit the table. It was just as I
               left it.

            NANCE: By a juror: Were any of the windows
               up at night?

            PEAVEY: No sir, we had those little long pins that runs in the windows. The windows
               upstairs in his bedroom were up. The windows
               downstairs I always locked with this peg that slipped in the window.

            NANCE: Were they still that way in the morning?

            PEAVEY: They were still that way in the morning. The lights were burning just as I had left them
                  that night; two lights, one
               in the living-room and one in the dining-room.

            NANCE:That is all, you may be excused.

            I hereby certify that I, as shorthand reporter, correctly took down in shorthand the

               **** Without a doubt he had a wonderful education. 
            
               POLICE: Do you know whether [Sands](sands) 
               carried a gun or
                  not? 
            
               [TIFFANY](tiffany) : Yes, he did. 
            
               POLICE: What kind? 
            
               [TIFFANY](tiffany) : He had a Colt's, whether that was his or [Mr.
                  Taylor's](taylor)  I don't know. **** I was down town with him several times, and
               he carried it with him once or twice to my knowledge, and he would stick it alongside
               the car and I would ask him what was the
               idea, and he just laughed about it, was all, but the man was a coward. ** 
            
               POLICE: Is he ([Sands](sands) )
               hairy, is his breast hairy? 
            
               [TIFFANY](tiffany) : Well yes to an extent, that is where it
               is long. 
            
               POLICE: He had long hair on his chest? 
            
               [TIFFANY](tiffany) : Yes. 
            
               POLICE: And on his legs? 
            
               [TIFFANY](tiffany) : Yes, extremely long, and he was
               ungodly.
         
         
            # TITLE OF INTERVIEW
            *YOUR NAME*
             MEMORANDUM RE: [JAMES KIRKWOOD](kirkwood)  AND [MARY MILES MINTER](minter) 

            [James Kirkwood](kirkwood) , [actor
                  and motion-picture director](kirkwood) , was [Mary Miles
                  Minter's](minter) 
               [first director](kirkwood)  when she commenced making
                  pictures for the American Film Company in Santa
                  Barbara in 1916. [She](minter) 
               was 15 years of age at the time.

            [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  then consummated
                  the marriage in a much more mundane way as a result of which [Mary](minter)  became pregnant. Intercourse went on for a number of
               months.

            [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  then left for New
                  York
               (late 1916 or early in 1917) and a clandestine correspondence commenced
               between the two. [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  wrote a series of letters to [Mary](minter) .
               These were sent to another male member of the
                  motion-picture company who delivered the missives to [Mary](minter) . The letters
               were in plain white envelopes labeled
                  [âJulietâ](minter) . (Mary' s true name was Juliet Reilly.)
               In the meantime [Mary's](minter)  condition was causing
                  [her mother](cshelby) , [Mrs.
                  Charlotte Shelby](cshelby) , (always a [suspect](cshelby)  in the [Taylor](taylor)  murder,) much concern. The [girl's](minter)  weight continued to increase and [the mother](cshelby)  tried all kinds of
                  diets.

            The correspondence between [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  and [Mary](minter) 
                  continued, but [the mother](cshelby)  at last intercepted one of
                     the letters. [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  at the time was staying at the
                  Lamb's Club in New York. [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  tore up the ground, to use Kary1s words, when
                  [she](cshelby)  found out what was going on.

            [Mary](minter)  was forced to
                  write a letter to [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  saying that they had been found out and that her mother
                  insisted that their romance end at
                  once. Also the mother insisted that [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  return letters
               written to [him](kirkwood)  by [Mary](minter) . 

            [The mother](cshelby)  then took this collection of letters and kept them in a safe-deposit box. They were given to [Mary](minter)  recently when [Mary's sister](mshelby) , [Margaret Fillmore](mshelby) , had a falling out with [her mother](cshelby) . [The
                  mother](cshelby)  supposedly kept these letters to hold over Mary's head but [Mary](minter)  says that throughout the many rows between [her](minter)  and [her mother](cshelby)  since that the
               latter never mentioned the missives.

            [Margaret](mshelby)  says that her mother once declared she
               was keeping the letters so if anyone ever
                  accused [her](cshelby)  of
                  murdering [Taylor](taylor)  that [she](cshelby)  could prove that if [she](cshelby)  was
                  ever going to murder anyone [she](cshelby)  would have
                  murdered [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  at the time.

            The assortment of letters from [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  contain little factual evidence and are mostly devoted to the
               outpouring of a [man](kirkwood)  obviously infatuated with
                  [the young screen star](minter) . He speaks of writing two and three letters a day and all the
                     missives were ended in a long series of âXâsâ or
                  kisses.

            Typical of the character of these fervent letters is the following extract: "[My
                  sweetheart](minter) , [my wife](minter) , [the mother of my children](minter) .â The last salutation was
               underlined.

            In the letter
               [Mary](minter)  wrote telling [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  that all was over [she](minter) 
               mentions anÂ· "operation" performed: by [Dr.
                  Hutchison](Hutchison) . It seems that [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  or [Mrs.
                     Shelby](cshelby)  arranged for this abortion.

            Only five persons, says [Mary](minter) , ever knew of the
               extent of this romance. These were [her mother,](cshelby) 
               [her grandmother](miles) , now dead, [her sister](mshelby)  and [Kirkwood](kirkwood) .

            [Mary](minter)  claims that this definitely ended her romance with [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  and that when she met [William Desmond Taylor](taylor)  a year or two later that [she](minter)  realized that [her](minter)  affair with [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  was merely an infatuation and that [she](minter)  really was in love with
                     [Taylor](taylor) .

            She says, however, that a year after Taylor's
                  murder
               in February, 1922, that [Kirkwood](kirkwood) 
               came to [her](minter)  and wanted to
                  marry her. She says she refused him because she was still in love with
                  Taylor's ghost and a short time later,
                  having obtained a divorce from
                     [his first wife](Lila) 
                  [he](taylor)  married [Lila
                     Lee](Lila) .

            Investigation at the present
                  time, although handicapped by the passage of time, indicates
               that [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  was in Los
                  Angeles at the time of the Taylor
                  murder at about 7:45 P.M. on the night of February
                  1, 1922. [He](kirkwood)  may
                  even have been working on the same lot
                  with [Mary](minter) .

            Old directories of the period
               give his address as the Los Angeles Athletic C1ub,
               then the habitat of many screen personalities including [Mickey
                  Neilan](Neilan)  and others. It was at the club that a
                  story was widely circu1lated that [Mary](minter)  one night
                  went to Taylor's bungalow and taking off
                  all [her](mary) 
                  clothes begging [him](taylor)  to have intercourse with [her](mary) .
               Mrs. Shelby is said to have arrived a few minutes
                  after
               Mary left and demanded [her
                  daughter](mary) . [Taylor](taylor)  refused to have
               anything to do with [the girl](mary)  after. It is well
               established, however, that [the mother](cshelby)  considered
                  [Taylor](taylor)  a menace to her control over [her money-making daughter](minter)  and hated [him](taylor)  accordingly.

            In a statement taken in New York in 1925 by
               former Chief Deputy District [Attorney Harold
                  Davis](Attorney) 
               [Mary](minter)  recites that [her
                  mother](cshelby)  "tore"' up the earth when any man came around her.â She recalled
               on one occasion, according to the transcript
               or the statement, that she was present
                  at a railroad station in Santa Barbara or Los Angeles. with [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  and others and the [mother](cshelby) , 'being momentarily displeased with [Mary](minter) , asserted that [she](cshelby)  would kill anyone that came between [her](cshelby)  and [Mary](minter) ,â man or
               woman and even included a dog belonging to one of the company.

            The theory of every person closely connected with the [Taylor](taylor)  case â Taylorâs personal friends, intimates of the Shelby
               family -- has always been that [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  either
               killed [Taylor](taylor)  or influenced some other person to do
               it. It appears that [Kirkwood](kirkwood)  had a romantic
               interest in [Mary](minter) 
               at the time of the murder and was
               also in a position to have been under the domination of [Mrs.Shelby](cshelby) --[he](kirkwood)  had committed statutory rape when he had intercourse with
                     [Mary](minter)  at the age or 15 and
                  [he](kirkwood)  was still married
                  to [his](kirkwood)  first wife in 1922 and
                  seeking a divorce.

            [The main witness](dougMaclean)  in
                  the [Taylor](taylor)  murder at the time of
                  its commission was [Mrs. Douglas
                  MacLean](dougMaclean) , [wife](dougMaclean)  or the [comedian](dougMaclean)  who lived in a
                  bungalow nearby. [She](dougMaclean)  heard a
               shot and looked out in time to see a [man](murderer)  leaving
                  the Taylor house. This was unquestionably
               the [murderer](murderer) . She says it could not have been a
                  [woman](murderer)  dressed in man's clothing. The
               description given at the time closely resembles that of [Kirkwood](kirkwood) . In addition [Mrs.
                  MacLean](dougMaclean)  said that the person appeared to
                     [her](dougMaclean)  to resemble someone in a
                  motion-picture get-up or in makeup.

            Another [witness](witness)  recalls seeing [two men](murderer) 
                  at Taylor's door
                  two nights before the murder at about 6:00
                  P.M. These were described as [tall
                  men](murderer)  ([Kirkwood](kirkwood)  was six feet and
               weighed 180 pounds) and [a very small man](murderer)  weighing
               about 125 pounds.
         
         
            # Interview With Henry Peavey
            *Campbell Killian*
             
            
               [Henry Peavey](Peavey)  accuses [Mabel
                  Normand](Normand) 

             In 1922, and again in 1930, [Henry Peavey](Peavey)  stated
               that he believed Mabel
             Normand killed [Taylor](Taylor) . For his 1922 accusation, see Wallace Smith's articles
             in TAYLOROLOGY 22 and 23. Below is the most detailed article containing his
             1930 accusation. Although the name of the actress is not mentioned in the
             article, [Mabel Normand](Normand)  is certainly the person
               referred to, because she was
             admittedly with [Taylor](Taylor)  at that time on the evening
               of his death.

             Frank Bartholomew
             LOS ANGELES RECORD
            
               San Francisco, Jan. 7--[Henry Peavey](peavey) , second missing witness in the
            
               [William Desmond Taylor](taylor)  murder case, was found in
                  a northern California city
             today by the United Press.
             "[I](peavey)  am willing to return to Los Angeles immediately and tell the grand
             jury all [I](peavey)  know," the young Negro said.
             "I'll tell them more than the [district attorney](DA)  let me
               tell the first
             time."
             "Do you know who killed [Taylor](taylor) ?" he was asked.
             "[I'll](peavey)  tell that to the grand jury," he said,
               nervously. He had been
             awakened from a sound sleep. He arose and wrapped a dressing robe around
             himself.
             "Did you not confide in [Dr. Thomas Filben](filben)  that
               ----- (a motion picture
             celebrity was named) killed [Taylor](taylor) ?"
             "Yes, I did."
             "Will you repeat it to the grand jury?"
             "Yes."
            
               [Dr. Filbin](filben) , who befriended [Peavey](peavey) , is executive secretary of the
            
               California Law Enforcement League.
             The person accused by [Peavey](peavey)  was the one named by
                  [Otis Hefner](Hefner) , another
             hitherto missing witness, in an exclusive statement to the United Press
            yesterday...
             "[I'd](peavey)  been working for [Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor)  as valet for eight months before [he](taylor)  was
             killed," [Peavey](peavey)  said. "He was my best friend. I've
               got his picture right
             here on my dresser."
             The photograph took its place in a gallery of pictures of actresses, most
             of them in semi-nude poses.
             "I went to [sic] [Mr. Taylor's](taylor) 
               house about 7 o'clock in the
                  evening that
             he was shot. I wanted to check out for the day.
             "Before I opened the door I heard loud voices. One was a woman's. She
            was angry.
             "I waited around for ten minutes, but the quarrel kept up. I wanted to
             go downtown, and I didn't know whether to open the
               door or not."
            "Did you recognize the woman's voice?" he was asked.
             "Yes. I saw her, too, for pretty soon I got tired waiting outside and
             opened the door to speak to [Mr. Taylor](taylor) ."
             "Who was she?"
            
               [Peavey](peavey)  hesitated, nervously. His glance swept the
               room, decorated with
             table runners and handwork which [Peavey](peavey)  made
               himself.
             "You told [Dr. Filben](filben)  who she was, didn't you?"
             "Yes, I did."
             "You named ----- ------ ?"
             He nodded his head, affirmatively.
             "Was that true?"
             "Yes, it was!" he cried in a high voice. "It was all true, every word of
             it! I'll go down to Los Angeles and tell it all
               to the grand jury. I'm not
             afraid!"
             "You didn't tell this at the coroner's inquest?"
             "No. They wouldn't let me. They tried to shake the story I told them
             before the inquest. They threatened me. I didn't change my story, because it
             was true, but I left out that part about the row at [Mr.
                  Taylor's](taylor)  house. Then
             I knew they would make more trouble for me, so I left Los
                  Angeles right away."
             "Who do you mean by 'they'?"
             "The district attorney's office."
             "You told [Dr. Filbin](filben)  that when the district attorney was questioning you,
             you said repeatedly, 'Why do you pick on me? You know who killed [Taylor](taylor) .' Is
             that right?"
             "Yes, it is."
            
               [Peavey's](peavey)  story had to be drawn by close
               questioning. He volunteered
             little.
             "At what time do you think [Taylor](taylor)  was shot?"
             "Sometime between 7:10, when I finally spoke to him and
               left the house,
             and 7:30 p.m."
             "Why before 7:30?"
             "His chauffeur told me afterward that he telephoned [Taylor](taylor)  from downtown,
             asking any further instructions for the day, at about half-past
                  seven, and
             couldn't get an answer to the phone. Then he want to Taylor's
                  house, but it
             was dark [sic] and the door was locked."
             "What time was it that the chauffeur went to the house?"
             "I don't remember. Not very long, I guess, because he wanted to get home
             himself."
             "What about this quarrel that was going on?"
             "Well, it was just a row, that's all. The woman was doing most of the
             talking. She was mad."
             "What have you been doing since you left Los Angeles?"
             "I came up to San Francisco and went to work for
               the Corona Typewriter
             company. That's where I met [Dr. Filben](filben) , in the
               typewriter company office. He
             recognized my name and identified me with the [Taylor](taylor)  case. He was nice to me,
             and finally when I got to know him I told him the whole story--the part they
             wouldn't let me tell in Los Angeles.
             "Then I came to this city and got a job as an
               actor. I played a part in
             'White Cargo.'
             "I've been around here since, and that's about all."
             The Negro section of the city where [Peavey](peavey)  was
               found has been keeping him
            under cover for several days, since [Dr. Filben](filben)  gave
               his story to the United
             Press in San Francisco.
             A negro political leader was finally prevailed upon, after a number of
             blind leads had been followed, to assign a lieutenant to accopany the
             reporters to Peavey's home.
             He was found in a two-room apartment in the rear of a home which itself
             faced the street. He had as a room mate a Portuguese boy, who was not present
             at the interview.
             "[Henry](peavey)  likes to do fancy work," the guide
               explained. "He's got it all
             over his place."
             He had, and upon the various runners and doilies was an assortment of
             powder boxes and paints.
             ...He speaks in a voice surprisingly high in register for his build. He
             is not well educated. The manager of the theater at which he plays occasional
             parts informed reporters that [Henry's](peavey)  bits in
               "White Cargo" had to be read to
             him.
             "I'm innocent of any wrongdoing," [Peavey](peavey)  assured
               his interviewers. "I've
             been working and earning an honest living and minding my own business.
             "My conscience is clear and I'm not afraid of anybody. I'm willing to go
            right down to Los Angeles and tell the whole thing
               to the grand jury.
             "They made me think, at the time [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was
               killed, that if I didn't
             keep my mouth shut about this quarrel and get out of Los Angeles that they
             might accuse me of the murder. [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was my
               close friend. I'm innocent.
             Now I'm ready to tell them all I know."...
         
         
            # Interview With Julia C. Ivers
            *Liv King*
             Interviews with [Julia Crawford Ivers](ivers) 
            
            
               [Julia Crawford Ivers](ivers)  was closely associated with
                  [ Taylor](taylor)  for over six years and wrote the
               scenarios for most of his Paramount films. After
                  [ Taylor's ](taylor)  murder, her career soon faded.
            [When Mary Miles Minter](minter)  was interrogated by Deputy
               District Attorney William Doran, on February 7, 1922, [Minter](minter)  recalled a conversation with [ Marshall Neilan](neilan)  in which [Minter](minter) 
               stated that the only person she could think of who might have killed [Taylor](taylor)  was [ Julia Crawford
                  Ivers](ivers) . But [Ivers](ivers)  was never seriously
               considered a suspect.
            Reticent and shy of personal publicity, she gave very few interviews throughout her
               career. [17] The following are some isolated exceptions:

             October 16, 1920 Giebler MOVING PICTURE WORLD I had the pleasure of making the
               acquaintance of [Julia Crawford Ivers](ivers) , of the
                  scenario department, a lady who occupies a
               large and closely written page in the "Who's Who and Why, and What and When, and
               Where, and How Come" of Filmland.
            [Miss Ivers](ivers)  says she has done almost everything
               around a studio but sweep the floor. She was six years at the Morosco studio before coming to the Lasky plant, where she held every position from film
               cutter and editor to superintendent of the plant. [[Ivers](ivers)  also directed several films.] [Miss
                  Ivers](ivers)  has a large number of original stories and adaptations to her
               credit, including Tom Sawyer, Huck and Tom, The Furnace, The Soul of Youth, two
               stories as yet unnamed to be produced by [Mary Miles
                  Minter](minter) , and The Witching Hour, now being made by [William D. Taylor](taylor) ; and in addition to this, she has published
                  stories and articles in many of the
               leading magazines. She is a person of
               decided opinions as to the writer and his relation to the finished film.
             "The writer is only a helper," she says, "and sometimes very poor help. More stories
               have been spoiled than made by writers who tried to put them in picture form, and if many of the writers who are
               yelping for credit on the screen should be debited with the lack of imagination and
               lack of vision they display, they would have no more to say."



             February 7, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER [Julia Crawford
                  Ivers](ivers) , scenarist for the late [William D.
                  Taylor](taylor) , yesterday gave out the following statement:
             "Today the friends of [William D. Taylor](taylor) , and they
               are legion, will gather to pay the last tribute to the man they love, to one who as
               man, director and friend measured 100 per cent. 
             "I have worked side by side with this man for seven years. We have solved many
               difficult problems together, sometimes pleasant, sometimes unpleasant: always hard,
               trying nerve-wracking. And during all these years of close association I have never
               known him to do one unkind, one ungenerous act, but I have known hundreds of
               instances of open-handed generosity and in most cases the beneficiary never knew whom
               to thank.
            "This man whose loyalty and honor were without question, who takes with him the
               undying gratitude of the thousands to whom he has lent a helping hand--this man who
               stood for everything that was fine and clean in picture, who is known to have declared that if it were necessary to
               his success to produce unclean picture he
               would go back to the white, clean snows of Alaska
               and dig his living out of the ground--this man was shot in the back by a cowardly
               assassin. He was given no opportunity to defend himself and [William D. Taylor](taylor)  would have defended himself, for he did not know the
               meaning of the word fear. And more cowardly than the assassin's bullet, lodged in the
                  heart of this dear man, is the tongue of scandal, which safely
               sheltered behind his dead body, is striking at
               his reputation--more cowardly for he is powerless to defend himself.
            "His friends know that when it is all over the character of [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  will stand, as it always has stood, for everything that is
               fine and worth while.
            "The good book says, 'Let him who is
               without sin cast the first stone.' And it is recorded that no stones were cast."


             April 29, 1922 HONOLULU ADVERTISER Scenario Writer is Seeking Material from Old
               Hawaiian Legends Hawaii may really find favor in
               the big motion picture studios and its wealth of
               legendary lore form the subject of a play or two to be presented to millions of movie
               fans under the name of [ Jesse Lasky](lasky) , providing
                  [Miss Julia Crawford Ivers](ivers) , his foremost scenario
               writer, find the legends and myths appropriate for filming.
            [Miss Ivers](ivers)  arrived on the Matsonia from Los Angeles, accompanied by her secretary, Miss
               Aldrich, and although here but three days, she is already delving deep
               into legends and also the history of Hawaii,
               particularly that relating to old feudal Hawaii.
            Whether her readings, her conversations with Island
               folk acquainted with legends, and her observations, will lead her into the path that
               will eventually open out into the appropriate theme, she does not know, but she has
               hopes.
            To further acquaint herself with the Islands and to
               absorb the atmosphere of old and new Hawaii, she
               will visit Kauai next week, leaving here Monday or
               Tuesday night and remaining a few days on the Garden
                  Island.
            The following week she will go to Hilo, taking her
               car, and will motor over to Kalapana, all through
                  Puna, thence to the
                  Volcano, and then around to Kona,
               where she will learn all she can of Kealakekua Bay,
               the scene of Captain Cook's discovery and tragedy; the city of refuge at
                  Honaunau and may possibly go into Kohala, which abounds in historic wealth.
            [Miss Ivers](ivers)  says she has been a scenario writer with
               the [Lasky](lasky)  interest for about eight years and during
               seven years of that time was closely associated in motion picture production with [William D. Taylor](taylor) , whose tragic death caused a temporary suspension of
               much work planned.
            "[Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was a splendid picture director," said [Miss
                  Ivers](ivers) . "He was a man of fine attainments. He was sympathetic and those
               who worked with and under his direction regarded him as one with whom it was a
               pleasure to be associated.
            "My own work as a scenario writer was pleasurable from the fact that there was
               co-operation. He wanted the best and we desired to give him only the best. He was a
               credit to the motion picture service and
               will be a loss to it, for he was of a constructive type, doing the best with the
               highest class of material."
            It was partly because of his death that [Miss Ivers](ivers) 
               dropped her own activities for a time, superinduced by a cold, resulting in the end
               in a determination to visit Hawaii, with
                  [Mr. Lasky's](lasky)  injunction that she delve into
               Hawaiian legends and find whether any of them can be filmed.
            [Miss Ivers](ivers)  is at the Seaside
                  hotel. She makes no promises, but is reading much about Hawaii. She is
               dictating morning and afternoon. She is going here and there where details of
               Hawaiian life may be learned.
            If such a motion pictureplay is to be
               written it may not deal entirely with legends, but legends may be woven into a modern
               type of play. The story of the Goddess Pele, who dwells in Kilauea volcano, has attracted much of her attention and
               her own visit to the volcano in a week or so will have that much more interest for
               her. There is a dramatic, tragic, firey element in Pele which may be
               converted to the screen, in her opinion.
             Much of [Miss Ivers'](ivers)  work at the studio in Los
               Angeles is associated directly with literary folk, writers of books whose names are known throughout the reading
                  world--[Sir Gilbert Parker](parker) , [Sydney [sic] Maugham](maugham) , [Elinor
                  Glyn](glyn)  and many others. It is [Miss Ivers](ivers) 
               who takes their books and prepares or
               directs the preparation of scenarios for the director.
            It is this contact between the scenario writer and the authors that counts for
               success or failure in the motion picture
               product. If the scenario writer is sympathetic and endeavors to get the soul of the
               author's intent, there are exceptional possibilities. If not, there is more likely to
               be a failure in the interpretation.
             Many books to be screened must be ripped
               to pieces. As the story is written it can seldom be filmed. The change is the task of
               the scenario writer.
            Life must have been lived by scenario writers to really interpret a story for the
               screen for the eyes of the millions of theater patrons. Phases of life that are near
               the raw edge of actuality and realism may not be interpreted by the old maid who has
               not seen life and whose first impulse, and probably her last, is to eliminate that
               particular phase. A man of sensual thought may regard that particular phase as one to
               work into a maudlin interpretation which would be offensive.
             Between these two extremes there is the middle course and that path must be taken by
               the writer who understands life and understands the multiplicity of types and
               characters that patronize the theaters.
            
               [Miss Ivers](ivers)  is a hard worker. She maintains high
               ideals as to picture production. Hers is a
               constant study of human nature. Philosophy and psychology are tangible factors with
               her, for both play important parts in decisions as to the worth of stories and the
               filmed product.
            "I must necessarily write in dashes where authors employ sentences and paragraphs,"
               said [Miss Ivers](ivers)  discussing her method of writing. "I
               cull and cut, where book writers must enlarge and pad."



             October 3, 1922 HONOLULU STAR-BULLETIN A dramatic love story with all the gripping
               beauty of the Hawaiian islands as a background is
               what [Mrs. Julia Crawford Ivers](ivers) , scenario writer and
               director for the Lasky corporation, has come to
                  Honolulu to film.
             The beaches, mountains, gardens and palm trees of Oahu
               and Hawaii are to provide the setting
               for the story, which [Mrs. Ivers](ivers)  says could be
               produced nowhere else in the world. "I wrote the scenario here," she told a
               representative of the Star-Bulletin at  the Moana
               today, "and this is the only spot in the universe where it can be filmed as it should
               be. It is imbued with the breath of the islands.
               When I returned to Los Angeles after my visit here
               last spring, at which time I gathered material for the scenario, [Mr. Lasky](lasky)  asked me if the picture could not be produced on the
                  mainland. 'I'll read you the story,' I replied, and I did. He had
               nothing more to say, and here we are ready to work.
            While the picture was not planned with the
               specific idea of giving publicity to the islands,
               it still will be of tremendous benefit in portraying to mainland people the marvels
               of this section of the globe. It will be a true mirror in which those of the outer
               world may see life as it is lived in the Paradise of the Pacific.
             "I wrote the story," [Mrs. Ivers](ivers)  said, "with a
               genuine love and affection for the islands, and I will produce it in the same way. No
               'roughneck' of a director will have a chance to squeeze the fragrance out of the
               plot, for I am going to direct the action myself. It is some time since I did that
               sort of work, but I have chosen my cast and staff myself. I know something of the
               atmosphere of Hawaii and I wrote the story
               myself. I am just sure that if we can get things into film as we see them here the
               island will owe us a very great deal of gratitude.
             "One scene will be taken showing the departure of a steamer and including that
               lovable custom of giving leis, which is to me most touching. When I left Honolulu last spring returning to Los Angeles I cried as the boat pulled away from the dock.
               I was not leaving a host of friends either, but there is something about the strains
               of 'Aloha Oe' which brings the moisture to the eyes and a catch to the throat. This
               atmosphere is what we hope to catch in our picture, and we hope that when it comes back to Honolulu as a finished product the people will think that
               we have done full justice to our theme."
            
               [Mrs. Ivers](ivers)  is a pioneer in the moving picture profession, having been identified with it
               in every sort of a capacity for the last nine years. She knows the game from A to Z.
               "I will have no one to blame if I fail to get a good picture," she says. "[Mr. Lasky](lasky) 
               permitted me to select my own cast and to choose my technical force, camera man, art
               director and all. I am in full charge and I have every confidence in my company.
               There is not a person in it who will not go the limit to do as he or she is told. I
               know they will all give their very best to make the picture a success."
            
               [Mrs. Ivers](ivers)  believes she is especially fortunate in
               her choice of her art director, George Hopkins. "He is really very
               superior," she said, "and has done some wonderful work on interiors. He has a weird
               touch which makes his work stand out."
             While a number of locations have been chosen, [Mrs.
                  Ivers](ivers)  said that they may not be used. "You see," she said, "the art
               director, the camera man, and electrician always inspect a location before we begin
               to 'shoot.' If any one of them has a fault to find I simply give up the location and
               seek something else that will be suitable. The art director and the camera man have to produce the artistic part of
                  the film . I have my company in the center of
               the location and I am often called upon to move the actors to one side or another in
               order that the camera may register striking
               features that may be at one side or the other of those of the cast. It would never do
               to have the film unbalanced."
            The very newest in motion picture
               camerass will be used by the company here.
                  The "Mitchell," a machine which combines all
               of the good points of all other cameras with
               none of their bad points, is included in the equipment brought from the mainland. There also are two
                  other older style cameras to be used.
            It is possible that work of filming may start before Friday, [Mrs. Ivers](ivers)  said.

            SHELBY: No.
            
            POLICE: When did you first see that, or did you at all?
            
            SHELBY: I never did know it, [Mr. Keyes](Keyes) , until [Mr. Mott](Mott)  told
               me of the letters that had been found in Taylor's drawer that
               absolutely is convincing that there had been something there.
            
            POLICE: You mean after he was killed
            
            SHELBY: Yes, and [Mr. Eyton](Eyton)  told me also after [Mr. Taylor](Taylor) 
               was killed that he knew that, that he knew for a long time that [Mary](Mary)  and [Mr.
                  Taylor](Taylor)  had been intimate, and I said then "[ Mr. Eyton](Eyton)  you
               should have told me."
            
            POLICE: During that time. [Mrs. Shelby](Shelby)  (referring to latter part of 1919
               and early part of 1920), was Mary going around with Taylor to your knowledge at
               all?
            
            SHELBY: Why no, and [Mr. Taylor](Taylor)  was the most perfectly poised man, such a
               proper man. He would take Mary out to dinner and he would invariably invite me and my
               mother to go to dinner with them.
            
            POLICE: Did you make any objections?
            
            SHELBY: Not the least in the world.
            
            POLICE: Were you friendly with him?
            
            SHELBY: Oh, yes. ***
            
            POLICE: Do you remember anyone in particular with whom she was associating at that
               time?
            
            SHELBY: It wasn't men. Men hadn't begun to give me any trouble at that time. It was
               women.
            
            POLICE: Who was that?
            
            SHELBY: [Jeannie McPherson](Jeannie) .
            
            POLICE: Taylor's name never entered into the discussion then?
            
            SHELBY: No. I always felt that, when Mary was out with [Mr.
               Taylor](Taylor)  she was under a good influence. ***
            
            POLICE: Did you ever have any words with [Mr. Taylor](Taylor)  over
               [Mary](Mary) ?
            
            SHELBY: Never a word, never the slightest word. (Speaking of the time [Mrs.
               Shelby](Shelby)  went to Taylor's home at 2 a.m. looking for
               Mary).
            
            POLICE: Did this secretary of yours, [Miss Whitney](Whitney) , go in the
               house with you?
            
            SHELBY: No, I know she didnâÃÃ´t because there was nobody in [the
               room](house)  but Mr. Taylor and me. She stayed in the car.
            
            POLICE: Did you have any weapon with you at that time?
            
             SHELBY: Good lord, no.
            
            POLICE: You are sure you didn't have a revolver with
               you?
            
            SHELBY: No, [Mr. Keyes](Keyes) .
            
            POLICE: Well, you owned a revolver at that time?
            
            SHELBY: No. If I owned a revolver at that time, I donâÃÃ´t
               know where it was. It was thrown away.
            
            POLICE: What date was it when you were at Mr. Taylor's home that you were telling
               about?
            
            SHELBY: I think I could almost fix that date,[ Mr. Keyes](Keyes) , referring to
               a certain little book, you know. Because I was reading
               Mary's diary and she goes on to say in this
               diary that she and I had some little words that evening,
               you see, and she has written it very clearly, about the small girl going out in a
               huff, etc., and she adds that mother was right. **** And I think the date of that
               happeningis right in her diary.
            
            POLICE: Did you ever make a threat to kill[ Mr. Taylor](Taylor) 
            
            SHELBY: No, [Mr. Keyes](Keyes) . I never had any reason or desire to kill
               [Mr. Taylor](Taylor) .
            
            POLICE: And you are positive, are you, [Mrs. Shelby](Shelby) , that you never at
               any time threatened [Mr. Taylor](Taylor) ?
            
            SHELBY: Certainly not, I had no reason. I never threatened to shot [Mr.
               Taylor](Taylor) . I don't think I ever threatened to shoot any man. To shoot him? No,
               because I had no reason. I had no provocation. I never had a quarrel with [Mr.
                  Taylor](Taylor)  in my life.
            
            POLICE: You spoke of having thrown a gun away?
            
            SHELBY: No, my mother did that.
            
            POLICE: That was your gun?
            
            SHELBY: Yes. It was a gun I used once. I shot it once and
               once was enough.
            
            POLICE: How long had you had the gun?
            
            SHELBY: The gun was given to me in Santa Barbara by
               [Harry Eaves](Harry Eaves) , who has a jewelry shop up there âÃÃ® a very
                  short little pistoi - a little automatic - ***** and he said to me,
               "I have got two and you ought to have one.
            
            POLICE: Where did you say you shot it once?
            
            SHELBY: I got a friend of mine to take me out in Santa
               Barbara, just off the road, and we shot it into a bank and I shot it
               once.
            
            POLICE: Did you ever do any target practice with it?
            
            SHELBY: Yes, that one time. It was enough for me. The thing was too short. I can
               shoot a long pistol. I wouldnâÃÃ´t mind shooting a shot gun. ***
            
            POLICE: Well, [Mrs. Shelby](Shelby) , [Mary](Mary)  shot that
               pistol off one time, didn't she?
            
            SHELBY: Yes, she shot it off twice.
            
            POLICE: Was that the "suicide"?
            
            SHELBY: ThatâÃÃ´s the âÃÃºsuicideâÃÃ¹ (Re: supposed suicide) "Well, we were living at
               56 Fremont Place. **** I remember the secretary was there
               that night, [Miss Whitney](Whitney)  *** She (Mary) rushed up the
                  stairs saying "I am going to end it, all. I am going to end it all.
               ** Then [Charlotte](Charlotte)  (Miss âÃÃºWhitney) said to me, "[Mrs.
                  Shelby](Shelby) , oh, [Mrs. Shelby](Shelby) , there's a pistol in your closet." ***
               But she ran up the stairs and ran in my room and closed the door.
            
            POLICE: Did she lock the door?
            
            SHELBY: Oh, locked the door, and the first thing we knew- bang. *** and a second more
               and - bang âÃÃ¬ the second shot. **** The chauffeur ([Chauncey Eaton](Chauncey) )
               appeared, and [the night watchman](watchman)  (?), and I said "Break in the door" The two men
               rushed against the door, the door fell in, and there lay [Mary](Mary)  on my bedroom floor ***
               They picked her up so tenderly, and Chauncey turned her over and he said, "Why,
               [Mrs. Shelby](Shelby) , there is no blood on her." **** By that time the
               secretary had faded out of the picture in a faint *** and she ([Mrs. Shelby's mother](Shelby) ,
               Mrs. Miles) said, "Why no, she is not shot; stand her up, Chauncey." *** Then she
               (Mary) looked at us and said, "I thought I would give you all a jolt."
            
            POLICE: ** was there anything said about Taylor in that? Did he have
               anything to do with that quarrel?
            
            SHELBY: No, I don't think he had anything to do with that *** I may have asked her if
               she had been out with . But there was no quarrel about Mr. Taylor? It
               seems to me she mentioned Taylor's name. I don't remember now, or what. Then the
               report that I got that you have been practicing some rerevolver shooting - is there
               anything to that? I told you I shot it once. I know a man who will verify it -
               Mr. Stockdale.
            
            POLICE: No other pistol at any other time?
            
            SHELBY: No, I am afraid of pistols. ***
            
            POLICE: What did your mother do with your pistol after
               [Mary](Mary)  pulled this stunt.
            
            SHELBY: That was all there was to it. Of course, we found [Charlotte
               Witney](Charlotte)  in a faint on the floor and we had to revive her. *** And
               [Chauncey](Chauncey)  was trying to find out where the
                  bullets went, and we discovered one bullet
               had been shot into my closet, and we found that, and another one went up in the
               ceiling of the closet. I remember mother taking the pistol.
               he said, "Here, give me that. ThatâÃÃ´s enough of pistols lying around.
            
            POLICE: What did she do with it. I never saw it again. I think I asked her once or
               twice what she did with it, and she said, "It's out. It's put away."
            
            SHELBY: I had an engagement with a man the next morning at 9 o'clock. ** This man was
               a client of a friend of my daughter's, Mr. Albert Heiner. *** I also had
               been talking to a man about buying an Aeolian Organ, and he stopped in that morning
               *** And while these two men were in the room, the telephone rang. It was then a
               little after 9, and [Mr. Carl Stocktdle](Stockdale)  called me up. He had gone to the
               studio to work and had learned of the death of [William Desmond Taylor](Taylor) .
               Naturally, knowing that he directed [Mary](Mary) , he called me up and told me
               that [William Desmond Taylor](Taylor)  had been found dead that morning.
            
            POLICE: Just what did he tell you?
            
            SHELBY: He said, "[Mrs. Shelby](Shelby) , I just wanted to call you up and tell
               you, I am at the studio. [William Desmond Taylor](Taylor)  was found dead this
               morning." "Oh," I said, "that's terrible." That's all he knew. ** I turned to these
               gentlemen and said, "Oh, my, it's terrible. A man who directed my daughter, a very
               charming gentleman, was found dead this morning." **** Then the
                  telephone rang again and the inevitable Miss Berger again. *** I
               said, "Oh, [Margery](Margery) , [Mr. Stockdale](Stockdale)  just telephoned me from
               the studio that Mr. Taylor was found dead this
               morning." **** In a few minutes the telephone rang again.
               *** This time Miss Berger said, "[William Desmond Taylor](Taylor)  was
               murdered this morning. He was shot." I said, "Oh, my, this is terrible; the man was
               murdered," Was shot? So we discussed that and the organ man knew I was waiting to go
               out with [Mr. Rice](Rice)  so ** [Mr. Rice](Rice)  and I got in his car *** and I said, âÃÃºMr. Rice, do
               you mind if I stop at my house and tell my people?" *** and it seems to me that on
               the way crossing Vermont met my mother coming over in a car with the chauffeur and I
               just waved to her to turn around and come on back with us. I remember that
               distinctly. ***** I was in a great hurry because [Mr. Rice](Rice)  was waiting
               for me in front, and I remember the chauffeur had parked my blue Packard in the
               driveway, and something was said about Mary wanted the car.
               [Chauncey](Chauncey)  had gone to get Mary's car. However, I went
               upstairs in a great hurry, and I said, "Oh,
               [ Julia](Julia) , dear, Mr. Taylor was murdered last night." She said, "Oh, it
               isn't possible. I can't believe it. It isn't true." I said, "Oh, yes, it is.
               [Miss Berger](Berger)  told me so." *****
            
            POLICE: Did [Mr. Woolwine](Woolwine)  ever try to take your statement?
            
            SHELBY: No, he never asked me a thing, [Mr. Keyes](Keyes) . Nobody ever questioned
               me.
            
            MR. MOTT: Tell [Mr. Keyes](Keyes)  exactly now, that part of the conversation with
               [ Chauncey](Chauncey) ?
            
            SHELBY: I said "[Chauncey](Chauncey) , what did you tell them?" He said, "I told them
               that you called me up very early that morning, about half past seven, and my wife
               said you went ever there without breakfast; that you wanted to go over to
               the Hobart house." I said, "The morning of the Taylor
               murder." He said, "Yes." I said, "Why, I couldn't have known until after 9
               oâÃÃ´clock.âÃÃ¹ He said that he drove me over that morning and said that I was at the
               wisdom with the papers I said, "How could that be; besides there wasn't any papers
               that morning." "No," he said, "that's what they told me down at the
                  office, that there wasnâÃÃ´t any papers that early." I said, "Well,
               that's nothing, it is just a laps of memory, it is of no consequence." And finally he
               saw he was in the wrong. I explained to him that [Mr. Rice](Rice)  had driven me
               over."
            
            MR. MOTT: Now explain that Monte Blue proposition.
            
            SHELBY: ([Mrs. Shelby](Shelby)  tells about some night when Mary had failed to come
                home, and they had looked for her until about 2:30 a.m. and finally located
               her car in front of Charlotte Whitney's house) So Margaret and I rushed in and went up the steps
               hurriedly and opened the door and came upon Mary & Monte (Blue) on the couch. The
               door opened right into the front room. This Monte Blue started to run out into the
                  kitchen and out the back door.
            
            POLICE: You mean that they were in a compromising position?
            
            SHELBY: Yes. I was about the maddest woman that could ever be. I grabbed this
               halfbreed Indian by his shirt tail and I said, "Come right back in this
                  room. I have something very forceful to say to you. Come back
               here!"
            
            MR. DAVIS: That time she went out with [Marshall Neilan](Marshall) , after the
               murder; wasn't that about two nights afterwards?
            
            SHELBY: Yes.
            
            POLICE: Immediately afterwards, wasn't it?
            
            SHELBY: It was.
            
            MR. KEYES: She tried to kill you, you say?
            
            SHELBY: Yes. *** Oh, "Mary said around the house freely. "Oh, 4 killed
               [Taylor](Taylor) ". Not only once but many times. The was always saying that.

            *YOUR NAME*
            
               
               Interviews with [Ethel Mae Harrison](ethel) 
               
               February 13, 1922
               NEW YORK HERALD 
            
            ...[Mrs. Robins](ethel) , who married [William Cunningham Deane-Tanner](Taylor) , or [William
               Desmond Taylor](Taylor) , as he was later known, in 1902, said her former husband had
               spent some time on a pony ranch in southwestern Kansas before [she](ethel)  met him in
               [New York](city) .  The only information she had ever had was that which [Deane-Tanner](Taylor) 
               gave her personally.
            
            "[Mr. Deane-Tanner](Taylor)  told me that when he arrived here from Ireland he had
               gone out to this ranch," [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  said, "and his family in Ireland had
               bought for him a part interest in it.  When I met him he referred to it and
               told me a flaw in the title had forced several of the shareholders,
               including [himself](Taylor) , to give up their part, and he then joined the Davenport
                  road company.  After the failure of his venture in Kansas he returned to his
               home in Ireland for a visit.
            
            "With reference to the claim of this [Mr. Taylor](Taylor)  in [California](state)  that he
               is the son of the murdered [director](Taylor) , I would not like to say flatly that the
               claim is or is not true, for I knew little of [Mr. Deane-Tanner's](Taylor)  life on the
               ranch in Kansas and did not find it necessary to catechize him minutely, and
               he never mentioned anything to me about having been married out there.
               Perhaps there is some truth in the story, or it may be another of the many
               persons who come forward whenever there is an estate to be settled.  I have
               been interested in the number of persons who claim [Mr. Deane-Tanner](Taylor) , or
               [Taylor](Taylor) , was their father.  To date he must have had at least six or seven
               children besides my own daughter, if the stories are all correct.  As [Mr.
                  Deane-Tanner](Taylor)  would only be about fifty years old now, that is rather
               ridiculous, I think."
            
             Referring to the criminal end of the case, [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  criticized the
               work of the Los Angeles detectives and prosecutors, saying they do not seem
               to be particularly anxious to solve the mystery of the identity of the
               murderer.
            
            "[I](ethel)  have bitterly resented the accounts printed in some of the
               newspapers here that my daughter and myself are merely interested in the
               financial part of the affair and are more interested in the [Taylor](Taylor)  estate
               than in the identity of the person who killed my former husband.  This is
               absolutely untrue, for, as [Mr. Taylor's](Taylor)  former wife, I am deeply grieved at
               this terrible affair and am anxious to see the guilty person punished."
               Returning to the discussion of the claim of the man who says the [movie
                  director](Taylor)  was his [father](Taylor) , [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  said that it seemed improbable that her
               first husband ever used the name of [Taylor](Taylor)  before he left New York in 1908.
               [She](ethel)  said that to old friends who knew him when he first came to this country
               and had been in constant touch with him during his stay in Kansas nothing
               was known of any marriage while he was in the West.  After that, and until
               he disappeared, [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  said, he never used the name of [Taylor](Taylor) , or
               referred extensively to his visit to the ranch in the West.
            
            "I never really knew [Mr. Deane-Tanner's](Taylor)  right age," Mrs. Robins said,
               "and I understood that he had been in his country about eight or nine years,
               when I married him at the Little Church Around the Corner in 1901.  He was a
               fine, lovable man, and I never had occasion to closely question him about
               his 'past,' which every one seems trying to dig up."
            
            No decision whether [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  or her daughter, [Ethel](daughter) , will go to
               California in connection with the settling of the estate has been reached.
               [Frank E. Schrenseisen](frank)  of New Rochelle, attorney for Miss Tanner, said that
               he was awaiting developments and instructions from the office of the Public
               Administrator in Los Angeles.  Another attorney for [Miss Tanner](ethel)  has been
               engaged in Los Angeles.  Should the Public Administrator place credence in
               the story of [Taylor](Taylor) , it is probable that [Miss Tanner](ethel)  will accompany her
               attorney to the coast.
            
             "[Mr. Deane-Tanner](Taylor)  told my [daughter](daughter)  that he had made a will in her
               favor," [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  said, "and had placed it in his safe deposit box.  I
               understand that this is another one of the items which the police say have
               strangely 'disappeared.'  What he did with it I have no idea, but I feel
               that the entire matter will be straightened out.  Just at present I am
               hoping that the murderer of [Mr. Taylor](Taylor)  will be brought to justice for this
               terrible crime."
            
            [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  commented on the strange disappearance of [Dennis Deane-
               Tanner](dennis) , [brother](dennis)  of the murdered [director](Taylor) , and said she had never heard a
               word from him since he left this city in 1912, just four years after her
               husband disappeared.  She said the two brothers had been good friends and
               business associates, and that [Dennis](dennis)  had visited their home at Larchmont on
               several occasions, and had met many of their friends.  There was never any
               trouble between the brothers as far as she knew, [Mrs. Robins ](ethel) said.
            
            February 14, 1922
               NEW YORK AMERICAN
            
            To the two names suggested in the New York American yesterday--[Edward
               F. Sands](sands)  and [Dennis Gage Deane-Tanner](dennis)  as persons whose discovery may furnish
               a clue to the identity of the slayer of [William Desmond Taylor](Taylor) --was added
               yesterday a third.
            
             The third person is a woman, a fascinating blonde who was the companion
               of [Taylor](Taylor)  (or [W. C. Deane-Tanner](Taylor) , as he was then known) on a trip through
               the Adirondacks during the Summer of 1908, three months prior to the sudden
               disappearance of ["Pete" Tanner](Taylor)  in late October, 1908.
            
            This woman, who had completely enchained the fancy of the aristocratic,
               handsome [Tanner](Taylor) , was married.  Her identity is said to be known to a few of
               [Tanner's](Taylor)  associates of the old days when he was a director in the A. J.
                  Crawford Company firm at No. 253 Fifth avenue.  She was the co-respondent in
               the divorce suit instituted some two years after ["Pete" Tanner's](Taylor) 
               disappearance by [Mrs. Ethel May Hamilton Robins](ethel) , now the wife of [Edward L.
                  C. Robins](robins) , managing proprietor of Delmonico's.
            
            Does this hitherto hidden episode in the life of the murdered [man](Taylor)  bear
               any significance upon the crime?
            
            Was the woman's husband implacably determined to avenge himself upon
               the [man](Taylor)  who had won the affections of his wife?
            
            Was it the hand of the husband that fired the fatal bullet (from twelve
               to fourteen years old, according to the testimony of experts in ballistics)
               that killed [William Desmond Taylor](Taylor) ?
            
             ...At her home, Orienta Point, Mamaroneck, [Mrs. Robins](ethel) , former wife of
               the slain [director](Taylor) , yesterday refused to discuss this episode in the life of
               her former [husband](Taylor) .  [She](ethel)  refused to see [newspaper men](reporter)  but told a friend:
               "[I](ethel)  would do anything in my power to solve the mystery of [Mr. Tanner's](Taylor) 
               death but I do not think there can be any possible relation between this
               incident and the crime.  It was not until long after [Mr. Tanner's](Taylor) 
               disappearance that I learned definitely there was another woman in his life.
               "This information was placed in the hands of my attorney, [Mr. George
                  Thoms](george) , and he brought a successful suit for divorce against Mr. Tanner.
               This was in the latter part of 1918 [sic].  At that time I did not know
               whether [Mr. Tanner](Taylor)  was dead or alive.
            
            "It was later, perhaps seven years ago, that I saw [Mr. Tanner](Taylor)  for the
               first time on the screen.  I cannot remember the name of the photoplay in
               which he appeared.  However, it was not until two and one-half years ago
               that I learned definitely that [William Desmond Taylor](Taylor)  was my former
               husband."
            
            February 14, 1922
               WASHINGTON TIMES
            
             New York, Feb. 14 -- Of the many screen stars he knew, some of whom
               have been thrown squarely into the spotlight by the unrelenting inquiry into
               his association with [William Desmond Taylor](Taylor) , slain director, mentioned but
               one--[Mary Miles Minter](minter) --in his letters to his nineteen-year-old [daughter](daughter) ,
               [Miss Ethel Daisy Deane-Tanner](daughter) .
            
             Disclosing this fact to a reporter today, [Miss Tanner](daughter)  and her mother,
               [Mrs. Edward L. C. Robins](ethel) , who live in Mamaroneck, both of whom were deserted
               by the man of mystery in 1908, said that [Miss Minter's](minter)  name was used by the
               [director](Taylor)  only in an impersonal way.
            
            [He](Taylor)  referred to [her](minter)  as an actress of ability, and said he had directed
               [her](minter)  in some of her photoplays.  This was one of the last letters written to
               his daughter by [Taylor](Taylor)  before he was murdered in his Los Angeles bungalow.
               [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  and her [daughter](daughter)  expressly asserted that the name of [Mabel
                  Normand](mabel) , screen comedienne, and last person to see the director alive, did
               not appear in [Taylor's](Taylor)  letters to his [daughter](daughter) , which had been more or less
               frequent during the last two years.
            
            Curiously enough, (and one reason why [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  is increasingly
               inclined to the opinion that her husband's sudden disappearance from New
                  York was due to loss of memory), her former husband never mentioned her in
               the letters.
            
            Another reason for this belief, she declared, was that on the times she
               and her [daughter](daughter)  lunched here with [Taylor](Taylor) --after it was definitely
               established that [Taylor](Taylor)  was in reality [Deane-Tanner](Taylor) --he never mentioned the
               fact that he deserted his [wife](ethel)  and daughter.  On these occasions all three
               felt the subject was rather delicate and it was never brought up.
               [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  said that when she and her [daughter](daughter)  became convinced two
                  years ago, after seeing pictures of [Taylor](Taylor) , that he was the girl's father,
               [Miss Deane-Tanner](daughter)  took the initiative and wrote to him.  His reply came
               immediately.
            
            In it he said he was very glad to hear from her; that he had not heard
               from he for so long that he thought [she](daughter)  was dead.  This is one more reason
               why [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  believes her former [husband](Taylor)  was a victim of aphasia when he
               left, after attending the Vanderbilt cup races in 1908.
               Taylor also, Mrs. Robins asserted, was unable to recall friends of
               their married life, and when their names were mentioned, his face failed to
               show the slightest signs of remembrance.  He did remember, however, favorite
               dishes of his former wife when he was dining with his daughter, pointing
               them out to the latter on the menu during their luncheon together.
               [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  declared that these points proved that his mind, while
               vague as to consequential facts about [her](ethel)  married life with the [director](Taylor) ,
               retained minor details.
            
             The director's experiences in Alaska also were set forth in one letter.
               [Taylor](Taylor)  told of how he contracted scurvy, consequently suffering from loss of
               hair, headaches and neuralgia.  Another letter dismissed with a few scornful
               words [Sands](sands) , his chauffeur, who is still being sought by police.  The
               [director](Taylor)  declared [Sands](sands)  had upset his home and said his name had been forged
               to checks by his unfaithful servant.
            
            Signatures [Taylor](Taylor)  used in his letters to his [daughter](daughter) , for whom he
               showed deep devotion, were "[Father](Taylor) " and "[Daddy Pete](Taylor) ."  The origin of how
               [Taylor](Taylor)  came to be known as "[Pete](Taylor) " was explained by [Mrs. Robins](ethel) .  She said
               when [Taylor](Taylor) , or as he was known then, [Deane-Tanner](Taylor) , first came to live in
               New York he took lodging with several Englishmen.
            
            [Taylor](Taylor) , always deliberate and calculating in his methods, was nicknamed
               "[P. D. Q.](Taylor) ," by his roommates, which was quickly shortened to "[Pete](Taylor) ."
               The [director's](Taylor)  promise to leave his estate to his [daughter](daughter)  was
               contained in a letter written in February, 1920.  [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  said her
               former husband said in this message he thought it would be good policy to
               leave them both an annuity, in addition to telling of his will bequeathing
               his estate to [Ethel Daisy](daughter) .

             [relating the testimony of [Taylor's](Taylor)  [wife](ethel)  during the divorce hearing in
               1911]...[Mrs. Tanner](ethel) , in her testimony, said she was married on
               December 7, 1901, at the Little Church Around the Corner.
               The ceremony was performed by [Rev. George C. Houghton](reverend) , pastor of the
               church.  Following the marriage the couple went to live at No. 40 Washington
                  Square South, and later moved to the Hotel Colonial at Columbus Avenue and
               Eighty-first street, at which time her husband became associated with A. J.
                  Crawford & Co., at No. 251 Fifth Avenue.
               [Mrs. Deane-Tanner](ethel)  added:
            
            "My husband left home at noon on October 23, 1908, and I have never
               seen him since.  The last word received from him was on October 26, 1908,
               when he was stopping at the Broadway Central Hotel.  He sent word to the
               Crawford firm asking for a sum of money.  This was sent to him by Daniel J.
                  Barker, of the firm.  Then he disappeared."

            MACLEAN: No, not at a11. He looked immaculate.
            
            POLICE: How was he lying?
            
            MACLEAN: He was lying flat on his back, his feet separated a little, his legs apart
               and his hands at his sides, lying perfectly on his back.
            
            POLICE: Why is coat appeared to be arranged you may say,
               just like he was laid out by friends.
            
            MACLEAN: Yes, he was perfect.
            
            MACLEAN: As I remember the coat laid perfectly along his
               body. It wasn't thrown back over or anything.
            
            POLICE: Was his coat buttoned?
            
            MACLEAN: I don't think so.
            
            MACLEAN: He looked just like a dummy in a
               department store or in a window of
               a store, so perfect, so immaculate. I remember I was impressed
               with the fact he looked like a wax figure dressed up.
            
            
            
            
            [MRS. FAITH MACLEAN](faithMaclean) : neighbor Statement taken on 2-9-22 POLICE:
               When did you first learn that [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was dead? 
            
            MACLEAN: At 7:30
               Thursday morning.
            
            POLICE: Who was it that brought it to your attention?
            
            MACLEAN: [His colored servant](peavey)  came screaming out of
               the house.
            
            POLICE: What did he say?
            
            MACLEAN: "Help, Police, [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  is
               dead."
            
            POLICE: Did the fact that [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was dead remind you of
               anything that occurred the night before * did you hear a
               shot.
            
            MACLEAN: Yes, what we thought might be a shot or a muffler
               explosion, I do not know which.
            
            POLICE: When did you hear that?
            
            MACLEAN: Sometime probably between quarter of eight and eight o'clock on
               Wednesday evening.
            
            POLICE: Now, at the time you heard this shot did you go out on the
               porch?
            
            MACLEAN: Yes, shortly after *** oh, about, I suppose three or four seconds, maybe a
               minute.
            
            MACLEAN: No I did not I just opened my front door.
            
            POLICE: Well, what did you say?
            
            MACLEAN: I saw [a man](murderer)  had already opened the door of
               Mr. Taylor's house and was looking towards
               Alverado St. *** I didn't see [him](murderer)  open the
               door; it was already open I think.
            
            POLICE: Which way was the screen?
            
            MACLEAN: The screen door was open. I think the
               screen door was open then it must have been to have seen
               [his](murderer)  figure as clearly as I did.
            
            POLICE: Did [he](murderer)  shut the door?
            
            MACLEAN: It seems like [he](murderer)  shut the door. It seems like [he](murderer) 
               leaned in and pulled it closed.
            
            MACLEAN: So it must have been opened because I distinctly saw [his](murderer) 
               cap.
            
            POLICE: You are satisfied are you, that the light came from Taylor's
               apartment out on the street through the
               open door?
            
            MACLEAN: Yes.
            
            POLICE: Did [he](murderer)  seem in a hurry?
            
            MACLEAN: No, [he](murderer)  was the coolest thing I have ever seen * * *. [He](murderer)  turned around and
               looked at me and hesitated. Then it seems as if * * * that [Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor)  must have spoken to [him](murderer)  from inside the house 
               *** [he](murderer)  thought he had spoken and he didn't. Seemed like [he](murderer) 
               pulled the door shut, then turned around and looking at me
               all the time, walked down a couple of steps that go up to [Mr. Taylor's
                  house](taylor)  there.
            POLICE: Do you know whether [the man](murderer)  that you saw went to Alvarado
               St. through the open court there?
            
            MACLEAN: [He](murderer)  went towards Maryland St. and towards
               the alley in between the two houses
               because [he](murderer)  was facing that way ready to go when I closed the
               door.
            
            POLICE: You knew it wasn't [Taylor](taylor) .
            
            MACLEAN: Oh, I knew it wasn't [Taylor](taylor) .
            
            POLICE: Could you have recognized [the man](murderer)  1f it had been [Mr.
               Taylor](taylor) .
            
            MACLEAN: Oh, yes, positively. 
            
            POLICE: Now, is it possible that it might have been this young man [Howard
               Fellows](howardFellows) , the chauffeur, that you saw there. Could that be possible.
            
            MACLEAN: I suppose it could be possible but it doesn't seem to me that he was [the boy
               or was the man](murderer) . He doesn't seem the built of [that man](murderer) .
            
            POLICE: Did [the man](murderer)  you saw have a smooth face?
            
            MACLEAN: Yes, [he](murderer)  did have a smooth face.
            
            POLICE: Did [the man](murderer)  you saw have on anything like a chauffeur's
               uniform?
            
             MACLEAN: Well, the only thing I noticed was [his](murderer)  cap,
               something tied around [his](murderer)  throat. I don't know whether [the man](murderer)  had an
               over-coat or not.
            
            MACLEAN: [His](murderer)  age I don't know but I should judge [the man](murderer)  was probably between 30 and
               35. [He](murderer)  was about 5 feet nine, just about ***, and [he](murderer)  was stocky, not
               fat, but stocky. [He](murderer)  had on a cap. It seemed like a checked
               cap with a plaid in it, and he wore something around [his](murderer) 
               throat.
            
            POLICE: Smooth shaven?
            
            MACLEAN: Yes.
            
            POLICE: Color of [his](murderer)  suit?
            
            MACLEAN: No, except it was a dark suit.
            
            POLICE: Now didn't compare in size with [Mr. Smith](smith) ,the
               reporter here, who is taking this statement? ([Mr.
                  Smith](smith)  was about 5' 7 1/2")
            
            MACLEAN: No, [Mr. Smith](smith)  is shorter. (The witness names the
               following men: [Mr. Henry King](king) , [Mr. Mahlon Hamilton](hamilton) , [Mr. Arthur Hoyt](hoyt) , [Mr. Berris](berris)  (first
               name Nigle?), [Mr. Ince](ince) , [Mr. Marshal Neilan](neilan) . Witness was then asked the following
               questions)
            
            POLICE: Now then, tell me whether there is any possibility that [this man](murderer)  you saw
               coming out of there was any of the persons that you have mentioned?
            
            MACLEAN: No, I think not. I think I would have recognized any of those people.
            
            ** when [he](murderer)  came out [he](murderer)  was dressed as my idea of a moving picture
               burglar**? ** because I remember thinking perhaps [he](murderer)  might have been
               one of the boys in [Mr. Taylor's](taylor)  company when they go out on
               location. MACLEAN: Not well dressed. I don't know as I would say slovenly but I don't
               think [he](murderer)  was well dressed.

               that.

               of[ Mr. Taylor](taylor) 
            
            PEAVEY: Well, I don't know anything about the love that [Miss
               Normand ](normand) had for [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  but from

            *Hunter Sloan*
            
            MRS. MARGARET SHELBY FILLMORE
             Sister of Mary Miles Minter
            Statement taken 3-10-26, at 10 AM.
            
            POLICE: You do have a recollection then that she was [ (Mary)](minter) home
               at dinner that evening?
            
            FILLMORE: Oh, absolutely, because [mama](shelby)  had cooked this dinner
               [she](minter)  particularly liked and hoped [she](shelby)  would come home to it.
            
            POLICE: How long did [she](minter)  remain there?
             FILLMORE: After dinner we went into the living
               room and [Mary](minter)  laid on the couch and read a book called
               "The Cruise of the South Sea Islands". It was rather a
               dry book, but the way [she](minter)  read it was interesting and we simply sat around home and
               enjoyed our evening at home, the three of us. Now I know [mother](shelby) 
               was not at home, because if [she](shelby)  was, [she](shelby)  would have been
               there, [Mr. Fitts](fitts) .
            
            POLICE: What time did you folks retire that evening?
            
            FILLMORE: We stayed up quite late, I guess [mama](shelby)  retired about
               10 or 11 o'clock. [Mary](minter)  and [I](mshelby)  stayed up and
               didn't do much of anything until about 12.
            
            POLICE: Well, you are quite positive that, after [Mary](minter)  came home that afternoon, she
               didn't go out again at all during the evening?
            
            FILLMORE: I am positive in this way; that we stayed up unti1 about 12
               o'clock, until after [mama](shelby)  went to bed and Mary's room is right next to mine
               and [I](mshelby)  didn't hear [her](minter)  go out. [I](mshelby)  am quite sure [she](minter)  didn't.
            
            POLICE: But you just said a few moments ago that she could come in without your
               knowing it.
            
            A Yes, [she](minter)  could have. ***
            
             POLICE: Then what time of the morning of the second of
               February did your [mother](shelby)  come back to the
               Hobart house?
            
            FILLMORE: Well, I should say around 9 or 10 o'clock.
            
            POLICE: When [she](shelby)  came home to the Hobart house, [she](shelby)  was acquainted with the fact that
               Taylor had been killed?
            
            FILLMORE: She said that Margery Berger told her **
            
            FILLMORE: ** [She](shelby)  (Mrs. Shelby) said, "[Margery Berger](berger)  tells me that [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  has
               just been murdered."
            
            POLICE: You are, then, positive that your mother was not at the Hobart house that
               night (night of murder)?
            
            FILLMORE: Yes, I am positive that she was at the New Hampshire
               house.
            
            POLICE: And that [she](shelby)  came in the next morning, early in the
               morning?
            
            FILLMORE: Yes, [she](shelby)  came after the call from Miss Berger.
            
            POLICE: Could it have been after 9 o'clock when [she](shelby)  came in?
            
            FILLMORE: It could have been. As [I](mshelby)  say, it was early in the morning. I know it wasn't
               as late as 11.
            
             Q ** You knew nothing of Taylor's death until your [mother](shelby) 
               told you about it?
            
            FILLMORE: No.

            Secretary to Mrs. Shelby
             Statement taken ll-28-25
            
             WHITNEY: ** and Mary stood up and looked at her mother and
               said, "Do you really mean that?"" and Mrs. Shelby said, "I certainly do." She accused
               her of being intimate with Taylor and then made other remarks. ** She locked herself
               in her mother's room ** and she got the gun and
               tried to kill herself, but there was a safety catch on it
               and it wouldn't go off. ** [Mary](minter)  was monkeying with this thing and finally the catch
               released itself and the darn gun went off. **
            
            POLICE: What kind of a gun was that?
            
            WHITNEY: Revolver. A little snub-nosed thing.
            
            POLICE: Was it a black one?
            
            WHITNEY: Yes.
            
            POLICE: Who did the gun belong to?
            
            WHITNEY: Mrs. Shelby.
            
            POLICE: Do you know how long she had it?
            
            WHITNEY: Oh, she always carried a gun. I mean we always kept one in the
               house.
            
            POLICE: She knew how to handle a gun?
            
            A Oh, I should say so.
            
            A ** one night when we (witness and Mrs. Shelby) went down to Taylor's
               after Mary, Mrs. Shelby took the gun, but I don't think she had any intention of
               using it on Mary.
            
            POLICE: Did she (Shelby)
               threaten to kill
               him (Taylor)?
            
            WHITNEY: Yes. Several people heard that. It was in my
               office.
            
            POLICE: When was it in your office?
            
            WHITNEY: That was in 1920, in the summer. He
               (Taylor) had finished directing with Mary. Charley
                  Maigne was directing her and Charley was in the office, and Taylor was
               in the office. **
            
            WHITNEY: ** She said, "If I ever catch you hanging around
               Mary again, I will blow your god damned
               brains out." She walked right up to him. She was just
               livid with rage and shook her fist in his
               face and swore dozens of times.
            
            
            POLICE: Do you know of an incident that occurred in which Monte
               Blue was supposed to have been run out of the dressing
                  room with a gun by Mrs.
                     Shelby?
            
            WHITNEY: Well, I don't know that she had a gun, but I know
               that he was run out of the dressing room, because he ran into
               my office from the dressing
                  room.
            
            (Referring to incidents surrounding visit of Mrs. Shelby to Taylor's residence in
               search of Mary) ** She (Mrs. Shelby) said, "I will take my
               gun, and if I find her there I am going to kill her." I
               begged her not to take it ** She wouldn't do it, so she went with the
               gun. **
            
            POLICE: She had the gun with her at that time?
            
            WHITNEY: She had it in her hand and her coat
               sleeve; she had big coat sleeves and the
               gun was in her hand hid by her coat sleeve.
            
            POLICE: Do you know of any other trouble with Taylor that
               Mrs. Shelby had?
            
            WHITNEY: They fought all the time. Always on the set when he
               was directing.
            
            POLICE: Was the situation getting worse a11 the time?
            
            WHITNEY: A11 the time. It was terrible.
            
            POLICE: Was there anyone else present at any of these battles,
               that you recall, over Mr. Taylor?
            
            WHITNEY: Well, Earl Stockdale. I am sure he was present.
            
            POLICE: Do you know any of her servants (Shelby's) at the time of the murder?
            
            WHITNEY: I knew them only by their first names. ** We had a butler named
               Frederick, a butler named Â¬â Ernest, and
               a cook named Pauline. Edith Stewart was
               Mary's personal maid at that time
            
            POLICE: Can you think of any friends of yours, or any acquaintances of Shelby, in any
               way at all, that were associating with or closely associated with them immediately
               prior to, or immediately after, Taylor's murder?
            
            WHITNEY: M. George Periolet. is at Engstrom
               Apartments, Los Angeles.
            
            POLICE: ** Have you talked to Jeanne McPherson at all?
            
             WHITNEY: Jeanne knows a great, big, large lot. Jeanne came over
               to see Mary a day or so after the murder. She would be a good person for
               you to talk to. And her mother, Mrs. O'Neil.
            
            POLICE: Well, going back to that old subject of the gun, I just wanted to be sure
               that Mrs. Shelby had it in the house for a long
                  time.
            
            WHITNEY: Oh yes, there was always a gun.
            
            POLICE: If anybody said that Mrs. She1by did not know anything about a pistol or
               revolver, and was afraid of one, that would not be true?
            
            WHITNEY: That's ridiculous. Mrs. Shelby was not afraid of anything.

            ROBERTSON: Yes.
            
             POLICE: What was the occasion?
            
            ROBERTSON: That was last Saturday night.
            
             POLICE: Who, if anyone else was present?
            
            ROBERTSON: [Mr. Hoyt](hoyt) .
            
            POLICE: He said she had been pesticating around there and got to be a great deal of
               annoyance.
            
             ROBERTSON: No, that was last Saturday *** that was the 28th.
            
            POLICE: 28th of January?
            
             ROBERTSON: Yes. She would come to his house and kick up a
               fuss.
            
             POLICE: What did he tell you about her kicking up a fuss?
            
            ROBERTSON: She threatened to scream. She was very obnoxious to
               him and all of these attentions.

            MR. CHARLES EYTON Gen. Mgr. Famous Players-Lasky Statement taken 11-30-25 at 2:20
               PM
            
             A. (Speaking of the morning following the murder) ** I was called on the
               telephone, I should judge at 8 by his
               assistant [Harry Fellows](harryFellows) , and he told me. He said,
               "[Mr. Eyton](eyton) , when I came over to [Mr. Taylor's](taylor)  room this morning, I
               found him dead." And I says, "Dead? What is the matter?" He
               says "Well, we have had a [docto](doctor)  here and he tells
               us it is a hemorhhage of the stomach. **
            
            A. That would make it about 8:30, I should judge.
             A. I didn't go through the house. [Charley Maigne](maigne)  and [Arthur Hoyt](hoyt)  and
               [Douglas MacLean](dougMaclean)  and [Harry
                  Fellows](harryFellows) .
             A. ** [Douglas MacLean](dougMaclean)  was the first man that put
               it into my head that he ([Taylor](taylor) ) was
                  murdered. He said he was confident that he had heard a
                     shot
               the night before. He said to me, "[Charley](maigne) , don't let them take his body away with out turning it over,
               because I think we heard a shot last night."
            
             Q. Have you any idea who did the telephoning around about
               the murder?
             A. No. [Harry Fellows](harryFellows) 
               telephoned me.
             Q. Did you hear anybody call up [Mabel Normand](normand)  or
               [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby) ?
            A. No. That all happened before I got there, if [Mrs.
               Shelby](cshelby)  was called up. [Mabel Normand](normand) 
               was called up, I know. [Charley Maigne](maigne)  told me.
             Q. What was the position of the body when you first saw
               it?
             A. The body when I first saw it lay right in
               front of the desk, with the head back. The desk was near
                  his feet.
            
             A. ** Of course [Mary](mary)  was engaged to
               marry
               [Mickey Neilan](mickeyNeilan) , so she told me, but I don't think
               there was very much to that.
            Q. This trouble with [Taylor](taylor) , when was that?
             A. He and [Mickey](mickeyNeilan) ? Oh, [Mickey](neilan)  said something one night. They were drunk and
               [Mickey](mickeyNeilan)  apologized. It was nothing serious.
            
            Q. Do you know [Neva Gerber](gerber) ?
             A. Yes. That was one of [Taylor's](taylor)  former flames,
               before any of this came up.
             ** When he went to war it was understood that when he came
               back he was going to marry
               [Neva Gerber](gerber) .

             POLICE: When you saw [Taylor](taylor)

               perfectly arranged, was it not?
            
             HARRINGTON: Perfectly arranged. I made the remark at the time, "I don't believe the
               man fell in that position." (Re man peeping in windows of [Taylor's](taylor)

               stopped naturally, rather frightened, and he didn't say a word, but whirled right
               around and walked out.
            
             POLICE: Do you know whether [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was there

             POLICE: How would you describe the fellow's face?
            
             HARRINGTON: Rather a good looking fellow, good features. Of course I couldn't tell
               whether his face was ruddy complexion --
            
             POLICE: Regular features?

             MAIGNE: ** After I got over the shock of Bill's
               death, was wondering how on earth [Bill](taylor)  could have fallen the way he did. The position that [Bill](taylor)  was in stumped me for two solid days *** If he had
               been sitting in his chair and had been shot, or if he
               had been shot in his back with his
               back to the door, he was lying stretched out with his feet towards the
                  door, hands by his side. There was no
               blood anywhere except directly under his
                  head where the blood had run out of
               his mouth from the hemorrhage and a little bit directly
               under where the wound in the back was.
            
            POLICE: Was the clothing all properly arranged?
            
            MAIGNE: Clothing all properly
               arranged. (Speaking of the condition of the room when he first saw
               it the morning after the murder)
            
            WINN: There were also papers on the
               couch? *** I know when you came up there about  9:15 or
                  9:30.
            
            MAIGNE: Around 9:30 or 10 o'clock. **** Before we had been there a half
               or three-quarters of an hour, I noticed three or four checks
               on the floor alongside of [Bill](taylor) ,
               cancelled checks. They were not on the
                  floor when I came in. This pile of cancelled
                     checks was almost smooth and level right on his
                        desk, just as though he had been interrupted in his work and nobody
               had touched them. ** On the night after
               [Taylor](taylor)  was killed
               I called up
               [Earl Tiffany](tiffany)  and had him come up to the
                  house. *** His wife came up with him *** The first thing he told me
               was that his wife had positively seen [Sands](sands)  at the
               corner of Fifth and Figueroa, I think it was, at 1:15
                  PM on the day before [Taylor](taylor)  was murdered.
               She had known [Sands](sands)  and [Tiffany](tiffany)  before she married [
                     Tiffany](tiffany) .
            
            (Second Statement taken 12-1-25)
            
             MAIGNE: It must have been about half past 7 in the morning of the day
               that [Bill](taylor) was killed that [Miss
                  Normand's maid](maid)  came over and wanted to see me right away. *** I hurried
               over and [Mabel](normand)  told me that [Edna Purviance](purviance)  had telephoned to her that
               [Bill](taylor)  had been found dead. *** and
               [Mabel](normand)  ** asked me to go up there, and I think there were only
               two or three people here when I got in. It must have been approximately 8
                  o'clock.
            
            POLICE: About what time was that that you got there?
            
             MAIGNE: About 8 or 8:30, I should say.The man in the corner court, just
               beyond [Miss Purviance](purviance) , on the same side
               [Bill](taylor) was on, he said he was reading an Evening
                  Herald and heard the conversation between [Miss
                     Normand](normand)  and [Mr. Taylor](taylor) , and heard them say, "Good
               night", and then the footsteps going back, and then immediately the whirr of the
               motor, and she had gone and the footsteps died out, and he heard the
                  shot.

               you were the first that gave her the information as to his death. 
            
            BERGER: I did! My god, the next thing they will say I murdered him. I should say not.
               I was the first one to give it to her? Absolutely not. I didn't know it until it was
               given to me. I think [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  called me up right after I got
               to my office in the morning.
            
             POLICE: What time was that?
            
             BERGER: I imagine about 7:30. 
            
             POLICE: Do you recall that you warned [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  that she
               should not be in that house (N. Hampshire house) by
               herself?
            
             BERGER: I did? Well, I should say not.
            
             POLICE: And that she replied over the phone that she wasn't alone, that she had
               [Mr. Smith](smith)  there?
            
             BERGER: I say that? How could I ever make such a remark? The first time I heard or
               saw you was after this murder, wasn't it?
            
            POLICE: Do you remember of ever calling[ Mrs. S helby](cshelby)  on the
               telephone and telling her [Taylor](taylor)  was killed or murdered?
            
            BERGER: NO - capital letters - NO.
            
             POLICE: Now, [Miss Berger](berger) , I asked you yesterday a question,
               whether or not you ever had a conversation with[ Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  on
               the morning of February 2, 1922, following the death of[ Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor) ? 
             BERGER: I did. 
             POLICE: At what time?
            
            BERGER: At half past seven in the morning[ Mrs.
               Shelby](cshelby)  called me.
            
            POLICE: Wou1d you care to relate to me what the conversation was?
            
            BERGER: Absolutely. Gladly. I arrived at my [office](work) 
               between 7 and 7:30 on the morning of February 2nd, 1922. My
               telephone was ringing. I answered the phone. [Mrs. Charlotte
                  Shelby](cshelby)  said, "[Margery](berger) , I have something terrible
               to tell you. The man that was in your office
               yesterday afternoon is no more. He is dead." I said, "What do you mean?"
               She said, "He was found dead this morning." "Who told you? What do you
               know about it?" I said. "[Lasky's](lasky)  just called me up and told me."
               I said, "Where are you now?" She said, "I am at the New Hampshire
                  home". I said, "Is the whole family there?" She said, "No, I am
               alone." She did state that  >[Lasky's Studio](company)   had called her up
               and informed her about half an hour previous to her calling me. It was
               between 7 and 7:30 that morning at my office that
               she called.

             POLICE: Did she appear to be fond of him?
            
            FELLOWS: [Miss Minter](minter) ?
            
            POLICE: Yes.
            
            FELLOWS: Yes, she did seem to be very fond of [Mr. Taylor](taylor) . - - -
               and seemed to chase him around to the studio and things like that. As far as I
               know[ Mr. Taylor](taylor)  never really thought an awful lot of
               [Miss Minter](minter) . I mean more than just to like her for a nice
               little girl. He thought more of [Miss Normand](normand)  than he did of any
               one I have ever known. I got there I must have got at [Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor) â house about 8 o'clock in the morning when I
               came there.
            
            POLICE: That is the day he was killed?
            
            FELLOWS: Yes, on Thursday morning.
            
             POLICE: Well, did you know that he was killed before you went there?
            
            FELLOWS: No, my brother called me up and told me[ Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was
               found dead. I understood him to say [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was found dead in
               bed.
            
            POLICE: Who was there, [Harry](harryFellows) , when you came in?
            
             FELLOWS: There was [Douglas MacLean](dougMaclean)  and the owner of the court I
               think, his name is [Jesserun](jessurun) . I think there was two men from
               headquarters and my brother, [Howard](howardFellows)  and[ Henry
                  Peavey](henrypeavey) . I am not positive whether the [doctor](doctor)  was
               there when I first got there or whether he came when I was phoning [Mr.
                  Eyton](eyton) . [Arthur Hoyt](hoyt)  and [Charlie
                     Maigne](maigne)  and myself went [upstairs](place)  and got all the
               literature and things like that that we could get and put them in a package *** and I
               gave [Jimmie Vantrees](jimmie)  who was [Mr. Taylor's
                  Cameraman](cameraman)  and[ Mrs. Ivers (Jimmie's mother)](ivers)  and ask
               them to keep the letters for me. Why [Jimmie](jimmie)  must have given them
               to [Mrs. Ivers](ivers)  and then then I went right over and got them from
               her and took them out to the[ studio](studio) .
            
            POLICE: What did you do with them?
            
             FELLOWS: Gave them to[ Mr. Eyton](eyton) . *** I donâÃÃ´t think any body
               made an examination until [Mr. Eyton](eyton)  insisted on an examination
               being made and that must have been two hours or 2Â¬Î© hours after the time
               we got there anyway.

               begin in the morning?
            
             FELLOWS: It was the studio. ...called for him I think at one o'clock. I took him
               down town to the bank, which I drove [Harry](harryFellows)  up to see you, I
               think it was, which I went home and called for him at quarter of four at
               Robinson's.
            
             POLICE: Robinson's Store? 
            
            FELLOWS: Yes. He came along âÃÃ® [Harry](harryFellows)  was waiting to see him.
               They talked there until it was pretty near time for me to move or get a ticket for
               standing after hours. (After relating taking [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  home,
               he, [Taylor](taylor)  said) "I will call you between 7 and 7:30
               if I want you.
            
            POLICE: You went around to[ Mr. Taylor's](taylor) 
               house the night he was killed.

            POLICE: Just describe your movements when you went there giving the time?
            
             FELLOWS: I called up at the house at 5 minutes after
               8 which I looked at my watch * * I called up and got no answer. About
               5 minutes after 8 I tried to call and I went out and got into the
               car, drove up 6th to Alvarado, up
               Alvarado to Maryland and right
               around in back there where his garage is, right behind the landlord's
                  house * * * I didn't put the car away then, I left the engine running
               and lights on.** I rang the door bell, the lights were all lit which I thought he
               might be home on account of all the lights being lit. I rang
               the door bell and the second time I rang the door bell I looked at my watch ***,
               which my watch says quarter after 8. I rung the door bell 4 or 5 times
               because I kind of thought he was in there on account of thoughts being lit.
            
            POLICE: Could you hear the door bell ringing?
            
             FELLOWS: Yes. I started away and I got about to the steps and I hesitated to see if
               I could hear him coming. As I hesitated there was no sound and I went and put the car
               away, opened the garage doors and put the car away, closed the door and walked right
               straight through the court down Alvarado.
            
             POLICE: You did not open the screen door?
            
            FELLOWS: No, never do open any door.
            
            POLICE: Did you ever have such occasion before, the lights would be on and he would
               not answer the door bell?
            
             FELLOWS: I never had any occasions like that. *** as I go around I notice there is a
               light lit in his bedroom and a light lit in his
               den. There is always them lights but it was a dim light.
               This time all the lights were lit, dining room lights were lit and they lit up the
               certains that much more.
            
            POLICE: His upstairs lights were lit?
            
            FELLOWS: One of them, just a glance I took at them.

               long did you wait? (Speaking of the night of the murder)

             POLICE: About what time did you arrive?
            
             DAVIS: About 7 o'clock.

             DAVIS: It was aroundâÃÃ® it was between twenty and a quarter of eight;
               it was within five minutes of that because I looked at the clock and it
               showed about twenty minutes of eight. 
            
             CHAUNCEY EATON Chauffeur for Mrs Shelby Taken 6-1-36, at 4:30 PM
            POLICE: He was murdered on the night of February 1st, 1922. "When did you first hear
               of the minder.
            
            EATON: If I am not mistaken, when I went to the New Hampshire house the next morning
               about 8 o'clock.
            
             POLICE: Who told you about [Taylor](taylor)  being murdered?
            
             EATON: I think [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  called to me from an upstairs window
               and said, "Did you know that [Taylor](taylor)  had been murdered?

             EATON: Not otherwise, about 8 o'clock. (Witness is speaking about taking the gun
               from [M.M. Minter](minter)  at the time of her attempted suicide)
            
             POLICE: Can you describe the gun which you unloaded which belonged to
               [Mary](minter) ?
            
             EATON: I think a 25 caliber blue automatic. I believe we could find the shells of
               that gun because I hid them on a beam in the New Hampshire house.

               admitted that he was in the company of Mrs. [Shelby](cshelby)  at the time
               [Taylor](taylor)  is believed to have been murdered.
               [Stockdale](stockdale) , interviewed at his home, 6325 Fountain
                  Avenue, chuckled when asked for his own conclusions on the long
               unsolved murder.
            
             "So [Fitts](fitts)  thinks I killed [William
               Desmond Taylor](taylor) ," he remarked. "I'll tell you this, I was never in
               [Bill Taylor's](taylor)  home. I met him at a big party thrown by Mrs.
               [Shelby](cshelby) ." Pressed for his own suspicions of the killer's
               identity, [Stockdale](stockdale)  promptly answered,
               "[Sands.](sands) " He referred to [Taylor's](taylor) 
               one-time chauffeur [sic], [Edward Sands](sands) , whose
               mysterious disappearance immediately after the murder and before authorities could
               question him, has caused his name to be listed among those "wanted for questioning"
               by [police](law) . The veteran actor, now 63, declared he was with Mrs. [Charlotte
                  Shelby](cshelby)  at her home the night was murdered
               February 1, 1922. He fixed the time of his visit from 7 to 9
               p.m. Police have set the hour of the shooting at 7:45 p.m. "I told my brother,
               [Frank](type) ," [Stockdale](stockdale)  said, "that I was
               droppin' in on Mrs. [Shelby](cshelby)  that night." 
            
               [Stockdale](stockdale)  said he first met Mrs. [Shelby](cshelby)  in
                Santa Barbara at the time when her daughter, [Mary
                  Miles Minter](mminter)  was working for the old American Film Company. ---
            
            June 10, 1937 [LOS ANGELES TIMES](news) 
            
             While authorities deferred definite action yesterday in the investigation into the
               fifteen-year-old murder of [William Desmond Taylor](taylor) , a 63-year-old
               film character actor stepped forward to make the most important statement to be added
               recently to the mazes of [California's](city)  most famous murder
               mystery. The new figure in the case is [Carl Stockdale](stockdale) , for years
               well known as an actor in Hollywood and who now lives at [6325 Fountain
                  Avenue](street) . 
            Disclosing that he had been a close friend of Mrs. [Charlotte
               Shelby](cshelby) , mother of [Mary Miles Minter](minter) , the latter,
               who admitted she was in love with [Taylor](taylor)  at the time of his
               slaying, [Stockdale](stockdale)  had this to say yesterday: "I have expected
               the authorities to question me for some time and have made no effort to evade such
               interrogation despite the fact that no one welcomes publicity of the sort. 
             "I was with Mrs. [Shelby](cshelby)  on the night that
               [Taylor](taylor)  was murdered at about the time fixed by the
               authorities that the fatal bullet was fired. That may be
               considered of importance to the authorities and is information I am quite willing to
               give." 
            [Stockdale](stockdale)  indicated that he is in complete sympathy with a
               statement recently issued by Mrs. [Shelby](cshelby)  in which she declared
               that, sick of the innuendoes which have followed in the wake of the
               Taylor murder, she wanted action to clear up the case once
               and for all.
            
            Although apparently unwilling to move at once, the District Attorney's
               office yesterday stated that [Stockdale](stockdale)  is scheduled to be questioned
               before the present investigation is concluded.
            
             "I am willing to tell all I know to the District Attorney or anyone else," commented
               the actor. "I have known Mrs. [Shelby](cshelby)  and her family for
               approximately twenty years. I was living on [Winona Boulevard](street)  with my brother
               [Frank](frank) , and my mother and father on the day of the
               shooting of [Taylor](taylor) . "In the evening I
               left my home and went to pay a visit to Mrs. [Shelby](cshelby)  in the new
               house she had purchased at Seventh street and New Hampshire
                  avenue. I arrived shortly before 7 o'clock in the evening and left
               about 9 o'clock."
            
            [Taylor](taylor) , as near as authorities could fix the time, was shot
               about 7:45 p.m. on February 1, 1922. Several persons in the neighborhood of his
               bungalow at 404-B South Alvarado street reported hearing a
               shot at that time. 
            "I was the first person," went on Stockdale, "to inform [Mrs. Shelby ](cshelby) that [Taylor](taylor)  had
               been killed. That was about 9 o'clock the next morning. I had gone to the studio
               where I was working on a picture with [Mabel Normand](normand)  and some one told me that [Taylor](taylor) 
               had been found dead. I telephoned Mrs. [Shelby](cshelby)  at once because I
               knew that he had been [Mary's](minter)  director and that the whole family
               knew him well."

             When a bullet snuffed out the life of [William
               Desmond Taylor](taylor) , noted picture director, in 1922, Mrs.
               [Charlotte Shelby](cshelby)  was at home. 
            
               [Carl Stockdale](stockdale) , veteran actor and friend of Mrs.
               Shelby, so testified in Superior Judge [Parker
                  Wood's](wood)  court yesterday.
            
             He appeared as a defense witness in trial of the civil suit by which [Margaret Shelby Fillmore](margret) , Mrs.
               [Shelby's](cshelby)  daughter, is seeking to regain $48,750 in bonds,
               which she contends her mother removed from a joint safety deposit box.
            
             "I was with Mrs. [Shelby](cshelby)  from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. in her apartment
               at [Seventh street and New Hampshire avenue the night](location)  of the
               murder," [Stockdale stated.](stockdale) 
            
            "I did not know of the tragedy until the following morning when I arrived for work at
               the Mack Sennett Studios. 
            "I immediately called Mrs. [Shelby](cshelby)  and told her to prepare
               herself for a shock. Then I told her Mr.[ Taylor](taylor)  had been slain. 
             "She screamed: 'Impossible!' "
            
             The actor's testimony, while perhaps not strictly pertinent to the present
               suit, was introduced to answer certain pointed intimations
               made during its trial, attorneys explained.
            
            
               [Mary Miles Minter](minter)  and the late [Mabel
                  Normand](normand)  frequently were mentioned in gossip concerning the
               [Taylor](taylor)  mystery, Stockdale said. But at
               no time had he heard rumors that Mrs. [Shelby](cshelby)  might be involved
               as a suspect, he added. 
            
             The actor also testified that he had seen Mrs. [Fillmore](fillmore)  under
               the influence of liquor four times between 1925 and 1931.

            ...[Stockdale's ](stockdale) testimony was in the nature of a reply to that of
               Mrs. [Fillmore](fillmore)  two days ago when she said she did not know her
               mother's whereabouts at the hour of the murder. Cross-examined as to whether he had
               ever heard that Mrs. [Shelby](cshelby)  was a suspect in the murder, the
               veteran actor replied, "I did not hear any such rumors, but I did hear rumors that
               [Mary](mary)  (Miss Minter) and [Mabel Normand](normand) 
               were suspected of the murder." ~~~~

            # Interview with Charlotte Shelby
            *Katrina von Behren*
            
            
             December 26, 1929 A. M. Rochlen LOS ANGELES EXAMINER
            
            In a remarkable interview, given exclusively to the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER, [Mrs. Charlotte Shelby](cshelby) , mother of [Mary Miles Minter](minter) , last night for the first time revealed hitherto
               unknown phases of the [William Desmond
                  Taylor](taylor)  murder case. From the wealth of memories so
               closely associated with the career of [her talented
                  daughter](minter)  she brought forth details that shed a new light on the many
               investigations that sought to unravel the tangled threads of the murder of the film director -- a case famous the world
               over. "The time for action has come. I'm not going to sit idly and be a target for
               base rumors and vicious innuendo. there must be some justice in this world -- even
               for a helpless woman." Breaking a silence of more than seven eventful years,
               [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby) , one of the dramatic and
               ever-interesting figures of the Taylor case,
               thus struck back at the endless chain of "whispers and theories" linking her, as well
               as others, in the events of that baffling
                  mystery. Of [Mary Miles Minter](minter) , who
               was a film star under [Taylor](taylor) 's direction, she had
               little to say. 
            
            What here is disclosed would remain forever in her own heart, she said, were it not for the rumors, reports and
               insinuations that are making her life a dreadful dream. Desiring only to be left
               alone,[ Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  now feels that she must cut
               through the web of whispers and suspicions to bring to an end the repetitions of her
               name in connection with the case. And she wants to serve notice that every recourse
               of law will be brought to bear to stop unwarranted bantering of her name and to force
               those who have used it to come out in the open. "I have made complete statements to
               the [proper authorities](police)  in the past and I stand
               ready to do it again if it will help in a sincere and honest effort to solve
               the mystery of [Mr.
                  Taylor's](taylor)  death," [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  said in
               the interview. "But somewhere, somehow, this thing has got to
               stop. I demand it. We cannot go through life like this -- I and my [daughter](minter) , [Margaret](mshelby) . We
               are not hiding from anyone one anything. All we ask is to be left alone, and somebody
               has got to help us fight this terrible thing." For the purpose of an earnest and
               legitimate investigation, [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  revealed for
               the first time to THE EXAMINER last night that -- She was not in love
               with [William Desmond Taylor](taylor) . She did not make
               threats against the [famous director](taylor) .
            
            
            She did not go to [Taylor](taylor) 's bungalow at 404B South
                  Alvarado Street at an early morning hour
               several weeks before the murder, armed with a
               revolver. She did not, shortly before the murder,
               purchase a gun and practice with it. "I know that
               some of these things, with many vicious details added, had been whispered around,"
               Mrs. Shelby said. "How most of them originated, no one knows. Some, I'm sure, were
               spread by a person formerly in my employ. I know that person and I know the motive.
               At the proper time and place I shall make known this motive, but in the meantime I am
               interested in just this: "I want to find out who circulates these rumors. I want to
               get definite information of definite statements against me, and then I am going to
               take definite action to the limit of my ability and the law." Mrs. Shelby's
               blue eyes lost some of their softness as
               she spoke. Only a few minutes before she came into the room to greet
               the visitor. Attired in a soft, clinging Viennese gown of golden brown, with brown suede shoes
               to match, she sat near the window of her charming
                  apartment in a court that looked like a corner of some far-away nook
               in old Granada. Outside Christmas crowds and laden
                  automobiles moved back and forth. [Margaret
                     Shelby Fillmore](mshelby) , always a close pal and companion of her mother, sat
               nearby. 
            
             The two had but recently returned from Europe. France, Belgium, Germany,
               Switzerland and Italy. Paris, London, Vienna -- art
               museums and Florence -- and then all the crash and
               cruel reverberations of the old Taylor case. "We arrived in California
               November 17. For more than three years we lived in
               Europe. You know, there are many things we
               do not discuss with the outside world. There are many sorrows one must always bear
               alone or with those who are very near and close. "My [daughter](minter)  and I (to Mary Miles Minter, Mrs. Shelby never alluded as "my
               daughter") traveled and saw everything that was beautiful in old Europe, but now we are back -- and to all this."
               As[ Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  talked, framed against the
               deep window and the dazzling white
                  walls of the courtyard, there
               flashed before the interviewer another
               occasion, almost eight years ago, when
               [ Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  was an actress in a drama in which
               [Mary Miles Minter](minter)  was playing the leading part.
               It was in the artistic living room of their
               home, on North Hobart boulevard, in
               February 1922. [ William Desmond
                  Taylor](taylor) , a man of mystery and romance, a leading figure in the motion
               picture world, was murdered in his home
               a few nights before. One by one several beautiful women -- names known
               throughout the world -- were brought into the case. And [Mary
                  Miles Minter](minter) , young, vivacious, and then at the height of her
                     artistic career, was one of these. Mary, her face like a Greek profile of
               exquisite marble, sat on a couch and told of her last visit with Taylor -- in the
               darkened chamber of the undertaking parlors. She had gone there alone to place a
               beautiful dark red rose on the body of the man who was her director, friend, ideal.
               And Mrs. Shelby, close by, listened to the story and watched over Mary.
            
            
             But yesterday, as the brilliant Christmas afternoon was
               changing into evening, it was a different story. "Yes, I remember that
               night, nearly eight years ago," Mrs. Shelby replied, and paused. "I want
               to forget it. Of [Mary](minter)  I shall have nothing to say.
               She is in good hands and can take care of herself, I'm sure. "In those days my whole
               life was wrapped up in her. It was my work. Now I must fight for vindication. I've
               had enough of this, and I am going to ask that they put an end to the case once and
               for all." Throughout the entire discussion [Mrs.
                  Shelby](cshelby)  was careful not to express any opinion on who killed [Taylor](taylor) . "[Mr. Taylor](taylor)  is
               dead. My daughter [Margaret](mshelby)  and I are still alive.
               We must be protected and not crushed by this gossip. "That's why," she continued,
               "the truth must be revealed, the truth must be spoken, the truth must be printed.
            
            "Of course I have heard the dastardly whisperings about me and my connection with the
               case. I have heard them all -- that I was in love with Mr. Taylor, that I owned a
               gun and used to practice on a target a short time before
               the murder, that I went to Mr. Taylor's apartment early one morning searching for Mr. Taylor and
               threatening him with death, that I had made many other threats, and so on and on. 
            
            "Each and every one of these rumors and whisperings is ridiculous". 
            
            Let us take them one by one and see," she declared.
            
            "I did have a gun."
            
            "It was given to me by a jeweler friend of ours in Santa
               Barbara, way back in 1916. That was a long time
               before[ Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was killed.
            
            "We were living in Santa Barbara. I was [Mary](minter) 's business manager. I had to read the stories for her
               pictures, work on the scenarios, watch over her
               clothes, the cast, everything.
            
            "We lived alone. No men folks in the household. Our friend brought the gun to the
               house one night. He said I must keep
               it.
            
             "'But I don't know how to use it. I never held one in my hand before,' I told him. 
            "'Well, let's learn,' he replied."
            
            [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  smiled.
            
            "You know, this really bears a strange element of humor, now that I look back on
               it.
            
             "We went out to some open spaces and I took this gun in my
               right hand. It was a pretty little thing -- had a pearl handle and all that. I
               pointed the gun at something or other, shut my eyes and
               pulled hard. The thing went 'boom' and threw my arm back.
            
             "I did that several times in succession. That was all."
            
            "Still, they call it target practice."
            
            Mrs. Shelby said she did not remember what had become of the
               gun. She says she has no recollection of bringing it back
               to Los Angeles when the household moved from
               Santa Barbara.
            
             "That much for target practicing," she declared.
            
            "Now about that visit to Mr. Taylor's house.
            
            "To understand it, I must take you back a few years. I must ask you to
               keep in mind the fact that [Mary](minter)  was at the height
               of her career, was making big pictures. We had been in New York. I negotiated new
               contracts. There were trips and conferences and all that. Many, many details that
               play no part here, except incidentally as they relate to the contacts made with a
               former employee for whom I sent to New York and
               who later figured in the visit story.
            
            "We were back in California. [Mary](minter) 's contract originally called for pictures to be made
               in New York. One day
               [Mr. Adolph Zukor](zukor)  held a conference with us. It was
               decided that climatic conditions were better out here on the
                  Coast for the type of picture [Mary](minter) 
               was making. So we came out.
            
            "[Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was [Mary](minter) 's director.
            
            "About the time of this much-discussed visit [Mary](minter) 
               bought a new car. It was a big, fast roadster, and [Mary](minter)  liked speed. She used to go out, tearing along the
               roads at 60 and 70 miles an hour. I was her mother and it worried me --
               naturally.
            
            "We were living on Fremont place. At
               that time of the year there was lots of fog at nights.
            
            "One night [Mary](minter)  did not come home to dinner. We
               waited and waited. She did not call. We began to worry. 
         
         
            # Interview with Charlotte Shelby
            *Emma Walkowiak*
            
            
             December 26, 1929
            A. M. Rochlen
            LOS ANGELES EXAMINER
            
             In a remarkable interview, given exclusively to the LOS
               ANGELES EXAMINER, [Mrs. Charlotte
                  Shelby](cshelby) , mother of [Mary Miles Minter](minter) ,
               last night for the first time revealed hitherto unknown phases of the
               [William Desmond Taylor](taylor)  murder case.
            
             From the wealth of memories so closely associated with the career of her talented
               daughter she brought forth details that shed a new light on the many investigations
               that sought to unravel the tangled threads of the murder of the film director -- a
               case famous the world over.
            (continued below) 
             "Perhaps she went to dinner at someone's
               house, it was suggested to me. We tried to reassure ourselves of this,
               but somehow I kept worrying about getting no telephone call and about that
               big, fast car and the foggy roads. 
             "We began to call up persons at the studio. We
               called the [cameraman](camera crew)  and the [assistant cameraman](camera crew) . The [cameraman](camera crew) , a big, jolly Irishman, was a favorite of [Mary's](minter) . He was married and had small children. She was
               fond of children and occasionally stopped at his
                  house. The [cameraman](camera crew)  told us
               [Mary](minter)  had not been there. No one could remember
               seeing her leave the studio. 
             "We thought [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  perhaps would know. But we
               did not have his phone number. No one seemed to know it. 
             "Then we remembered that one day
               [Mary](minter)  and her grandmother, [Juliette B. Miles](miles) , went to [Mr. Taylor's](taylor)  home
               for tea. 
             "[Chauncey](chauncey) , our chauffeur, drove them, so we
               called [Chauncey](chauncey)  and asked him if he knew where
               [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  lived. He said he thought he could
               find the place but did not know the
               address. 
             "So we started out, [Chauncey](chauncey) , my secretary and
               [I](cshelby) . 
             "We drove around and around. the chauffeur
               said he knew the neighborhood but was not
               certain of the exact location. Finally he remembered it. We stopped at the corner of Fourth and Alvarado streets. It was
               close to midnight then. 
             "[Chauncey](chauncey)  said he did not know which bungalow was [Mr.
                  Taylor's](taylor) . There were a number of them," [Mrs.
                     Shelby](cshelby)  went on, making a wide sweep with her right arm. "As I remember it, there were some on the left, some on the right and some bungalows in the
                           back. 
             "I saw a light burning in a window on the right, so I rang the bell, or knocked, I don't remember which. Some one
               answered and I asked them if they knew where [Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor)  lived. They pointed to a house on
                     the left side of the court, the last one in the back. I went there and
               rang the bell. The house was dark. 
             "[Mr. Taylor's](taylor)  voice came from the second story window. 
             "'Who is there?' he asked." 
             "'This is [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby) ,[ Mr.
               Taylor](taylor) ,' I answered. 
             "'I'll be right down,' he replied and in a short time opened the door and asked me
               to step in. 
             "I entered the room, a sort of combination living and dining room. [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  showed much interest. He, too, appeared worried
               over [Mary](minter) 's absence. Then he suggested some more
               persons to call. I waited while he used the telephone. 
             "I remember that he stepped into a sort of a telephone
               room -- an out of the way nook, and called. He talked to an assistant
               director, I think his name was [Frank O'Connor](o'connor) ,
               and he called several others. None had seen [Mary](minter)  or
               knew where she had gone. 
             "By this time we both were considerably worried. 
             "After some conversation, in which I mentioned my fears of an accident, I left." 
             "'Be sure to call me and let me know if anything had happened,'[ Mr. Taylor](taylor)  said as he bade me goodbye. I went to
               our car, where [Charlotte Whitney, the secretary](whitney) , waited for me, and we went
               home. 
             "I do not now remember the time of this visit. It was not, as has been whispered
               around, shortly before [Mr. Taylor's](taylor) 
                  murder. I did not 'storm' into the
                     house, with a loaded revolver
               in hand, as has been whispered around. I did not threaten [Mr.
                  Taylor](taylor) , as has been said." 
            
               [Miss Minter](minter) , [Mrs.
                  Shelby](cshelby)  said, came home some time later. 
             "She never told us where she had been that night. We were relieved to
               learn that there had been no accident and that she was well. 
             "But months later we learned about that trip. [Frank
               Urson](urson) , a dear friend of the family, and an old associate from Santa
               Barbara days, told me that he had run across [Mary](minter) ,
               driving her big roadster at 55 miles an hour and
               that he took her in tow and finally sent her home. He told me he feared she would meet with an accident and warned
               us against her habit of speeding. 
             "Certainly," [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  declared, "this incident
               is not a hot murder mystery clue. Certainly, had there been anything sinister in
               that night visit, I would not have taken two witnesses me or made
               public inquiry for [Mr.
                  Taylor's](taylor)  residence. 
             "And yet," [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  went on," some one related
               this story and some one has been keeping it alive, until today it is one of the
               endless chains of clues and rumors that keep bobbing up on the least provocation. 
             "What's more," [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  declared, this story,
               along with all sorts of others, was related to former District Attorney [Asa Keyes](keyes) . 
             "I made a complete statement to [Mr. Keyes](keyes)  after he
               returned from New York. I held back nothing. Why
               this 'mystery' should be resurrected ever so often, is beyond me." 
             "To the world in general the [Taylor](taylor)  murder case
               brought thrills, mystery and the glamour of big names, but to others it brought
               tragedy and sorrow," she said. 
             There was a long pause. 
             Perhaps the hectic days of the first [Taylor](taylor)  case
               investigation were ringing through[ Mrs. Shelby's](cshelby) 
               mind. Perhaps there came a train of thought that carried swiftly the amazing story of
               [Mary's](minter)  rise and the events that followed her
               famous director's unexplained murder. 
             If [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  thought about the $1,000,000 suit filed by her
               daughter in 1926 and of her demand for accountings, for audits and
               for return of money earned in the
               films, she gave no indication of this. 
             And if the drama of that intense recital of [Mary's](minter)  visit to the body of [Taylor](taylor) , recalled to her a few minutes before,
               took her back to memories tinged with the romance of her beautiful daughter,
               [Mrs. Shelby ](cshelby) managed to hide her emotions. 
             Earlier in the interview some allusion was made to [Mary Miles
               Minter's](minter)  glowing account of the slain director and to the love letters
               and tokens, most of them unidentified, found in his
                  apartment
               after the murder. 
             "I'm sure, [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  was a gentleman," [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  said. 
             She hesitated a little, and then went on. 
             "I'm going to rip all this innuendo wide open -- there is no other way," she went
               on. 
             "I know that there have been reports that I was in love with [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  and that I was jealous of my daughter and also feared that
               [Mary's ](minter) career would suffer, and that I killed
               [Taylor](taylor)  to preserve my love and [Mary's](minter)  film future. 
             "I am repeating these things just to show the absurdity of them. How is it possible
               to have such a double motive? The mere repetition of it shows the absurdity of the
               whole thing. Killing [Mr. Taylor ](taylor) would have wrecked
               [Mary's](minter)  career instead of saving it. 
             "But aside from that, the whole thing is ridiculous -- and vicious. 
             "I am a woman who has always stood alone. 
             "I was not in love with [William Desmond Taylor](taylor) . I
               was not in love with anyone. And no one was in love with me. I never held a purely
               social conversation with [Mr. Taylor](taylor)  in my life. He
               was always aloof, a man of mystery, polished, distant and reserved. 
             "In those days my tasks and interests were few. I lived, talked,
               planned and worked only for [Mary](minter)  and her pictures. 
             "How utterly ridiculous, how unjust and criminal, to cast accusations of such flimsy
               nature, merely on 'clues' of such thin stuff. A crime without a motive, or reason." 
            
               [Mrs. Shelby's](cshelby)  references to [Taylor](taylor)  were most impersonal. In fact, she said during the interview,
               [Taylor](taylor)  himself was impersonal. 
             She came back to the night of February 1, 1922, when [Taylor](taylor)  was shot and killed only a few minutes after
                  the vivacious [Mabel Normand](normand) , his dinner guest
                  that night, left
               the bungalow of the man she, along with
               many others, admired. 
             She talked of [Sands -- Edward F. Sands](sands) , the
               butler-valet of the slain director who robbed and flaunted
                  his employer because he knew of his checkered past. 
             Of the incidents leading up to and following the actual slaying of ["Bill" Taylor](taylor) , [Mrs.
                  Shelby](cshelby)  said but little. She refused to express an opinion. And of
               [Henry Peavey](peavey) , the colored house boy and cook,
               who served dinner on the night of the
                  murder and left just before [Miss
                     Normand](normand) , [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  also
               had little to say. 
             "I do not remember seeing him at the [Taylor](taylor) 
               bungalow the night I called to see [Mr. Taylor](taylor) ," was
               all she said. 
             "But this point seems to be overlooked generally when these vicious whispers are
               passed about," [Mrs. Shelby](shelby)  added. 
             "The time of the murder was pretty well fixed. [Mrs. Douglas MacLean](maclean) , who heard the
                  shot, saw [a man ](unidentified man) leave the
               [Taylor](taylor) 
                  bungalow. [Mrs. MacLean](maclean)  was in
               her own apartment, and from the front door, only a short distance away,
               saw [this man](unidentified man)  and described [him](unidentified man) . 
             "Do I answer that description?" [Mrs. Shelby](cshelby)  said
               smilingly as she rose to her feet and held out her silk-encased arms. 
             "Dressed in men's clothes? But why" Why
               would a woman run the extra risk of being detected by wearing clothes in which she at once would become
               conspicuous? 
             "This whole affair, however, is far from a jest to us. As I have said before, I have
               made complete statements and stand ready to make them if needed and if they can be of
               any use. 
             "But I will not remain idle and be a target. From now on I am going to seek out
               those who circulate these rumors. 
             "I am back in California, the land I love. I am
               not in seclusion, as has been printed, nor am I hiding from any one or anything.
               There are some things that I must reserve for the future. Some of them may hold the
               solution to the motive for the circulation of these cruel rumors." 
            
               [Mrs. Shelby ](cshelby) rose to bid her interviewer good-by. 
             "You may add," she said smilingly, "that I will remain right here and that if I do move from this
               charming apartment to our own home, I will not be in seclusion or in
               hiding."

            DETECTIVE STATEMENTS
            
            MR. CAHILL: We tested that and the bullet --- the gun was
               not more than an inch away from [his body](taylor)  and they
               couldn't possibly get that close. 
            MR. WOOLWINE: I heard it was 2 to 4 inches.
            
            MR. CAHILL: No, we have got it to within an inch, the test shows that.
            
            MR. WINN: In my opinion, the shot that was fired
               4 inches from the pants in making
               that demonstration, is the nearest likeness to
               the shot in the coat.
