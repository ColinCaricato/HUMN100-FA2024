               Interviews with [Ethel Mae Harrison](ethel) 
               
              February 13, 1922
              NEW YORK HERALD 
           
            ...[Mrs. Robins](ethel) , who married [William Cunningham Deane-Tanner](Taylor) , or [William
               Desmond Taylor](Taylor) , as he was later known, in 1902, said her former husband had
               spent some time on a pony ranch in southwestern Kansas before [she](ethel)  met him in
               [New York](city) .  The only information she had ever had was that which [Deane-Tanner](Taylor) 
               gave her personally.
            
            "[Mr. Deane-Tanner](Taylor)  told me that when he arrived here from Ireland he had
               gone out to this ranch," [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  said, "and his family in Ireland had
               bought for him a part interest in it.  When I met him he referred to it and
               told me a flaw in the title had forced several of the shareholders,
               including [himself](Taylor) , to give up their part, and he then joined the Davenport
               road company.  After the failure of his venture in Kansas he returned to his
               home in Ireland for a visit.
            
            "With reference to the claim of this [Mr. Taylor](Taylor)  in [California](state)  that he
               is the son of the murdered [director](Taylor) , I would not like to say flatly that the
               claim is or is not true, for I knew little of [Mr. Deane-Tanner's](Taylor)  life on the
               ranch in Kansas and did not find it necessary to catechize him minutely, and
               he never mentioned anything to me about having been married out there.
               Perhaps there is some truth in the story, or it may be another of the many
               persons who come forward whenever there is an estate to be settled.  I have
               been interested in the number of persons who claim [Mr. Deane-Tanner](Taylor) , or
                  [Taylor](Taylor) , was their father.  To date he must have had at least six or seven
                  children besides my own daughter, if the stories are all correct.  As [Mr.
               Deane-Tanner](Taylor)  would only be about fifty years old now, that is rather
               ridiculous, I think."
             
             Referring to the criminal end of the case, [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  criticized the
               work of the Los Angeles detectives and prosecutors, saying they do not seem
               to be particularly anxious to solve the mystery of the identity of the
               murderer.
               
            "[I](ethel)  have bitterly resented the accounts printed in some of the
               newspapers here that my daughter and myself are merely interested in the
               financial part of the affair and are more interested in the [Taylor](Taylor)  estate
               than in the identity of the person who killed my former husband.  This is
               absolutely untrue, for, as [Mr. Taylor's](Taylor)  former wife, I am deeply grieved at
               this terrible affair and am anxious to see the guilty person punished."
               Returning to the discussion of the claim of the man who says the [movie
               director](Taylor)  was his [father](Taylor) , [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  said that it seemed improbable that her
               first husband ever used the name of [Taylor](Taylor)  before he left New York in 1908.
               [She](ethel)  said that to old friends who knew him when he first came to this country
               and had been in constant touch with him during his stay in Kansas nothing
               was known of any marriage while he was in the West.  After that, and until
               he disappeared, [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  said, he never used the name of [Taylor](Taylor) , or
               referred extensively to his visit to the ranch in the West.
            
            "I never really knew [Mr. Deane-Tanner's](Taylor)  right age," Mrs. Robins said,
               "and I understood that he had been in his country about eight or nine years,
               when I married him at the Little Church Around the Corner in 1901.  He was a
               fine, lovable man, and I never had occasion to closely question him about
               his 'past,' which every one seems trying to dig up."
              
            No decision whether [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  or her daughter, [Ethel](daughter) , will go to
               California in connection with the settling of the estate has been reached.
               [Frank E. Schrenseisen](frank)  of New Rochelle, attorney for Miss Tanner, said that
               he was awaiting developments and instructions from the office of the Public
               Administrator in Los Angeles.  Another attorney for [Miss Tanner](ethel)  has been
               engaged in Los Angeles.  Should the Public Administrator place credence in
                  the story of [Taylor](Taylor) , it is probable that [Miss Tanner](ethel)  will accompany her
               attorney to the coast.
           
             "[Mr. Deane-Tanner](Taylor)  told my [daughter](daughter)  that he had made a will in her
               favor," [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  said, "and had placed it in his safe deposit box.  I
               understand that this is another one of the items which the police say have
               strangely 'disappeared.'  What he did with it I have no idea, but I feel
               that the entire matter will be straightened out.  Just at present I am
               hoping that the murderer of [Mr. Taylor](Taylor)  will be brought to justice for this
               terrible crime."
              
            [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  commented on the strange disappearance of [Dennis Deane-
               Tanner](dennis) , [brother](dennis)  of the murdered [director](Taylor) , and said she had never heard a
               word from him since he left this city in 1912, just four years after her
               husband disappeared.  She said the two brothers had been good friends and
               business associates, and that [Dennis](dennis)  had visited their home at Larchmont on
               several occasions, and had met many of their friends.  There was never any
               trouble between the brothers as far as she knew, [Mrs. Robins ](ethel) said.
            
               February 14, 1922
               NEW YORK AMERICAN
              
            To the two names suggested in the New York American yesterday--[Edward
               F. Sands](sands)  and [Dennis Gage Deane-Tanner](dennis)  as persons whose discovery may furnish
               a clue to the identity of the slayer of [William Desmond Taylor](Taylor) --was added
               yesterday a third.
             
             The third person is a woman, a fascinating blonde who was the companion
               of [Taylor](Taylor)  (or [W. C. Deane-Tanner](Taylor) , as he was then known) on a trip through
               the Adirondacks during the Summer of 1908, three months prior to the sudden
               disappearance of ["Pete" Tanner](Taylor)  in late October, 1908.
              
            This woman, who had completely enchained the fancy of the aristocratic,
               handsome [Tanner](Taylor) , was married.  Her identity is said to be known to a few of
               [Tanner's](Taylor)  associates of the old days when he was a director in the A. J.
               Crawford Company firm at No. 253 Fifth avenue.  She was the co-respondent in
               the divorce suit instituted some two years after ["Pete" Tanner's](Taylor) 
               disappearance by [Mrs. Ethel May Hamilton Robins](ethel) , now the wife of [Edward L.
               C. Robins](robins) , managing proprietor of Delmonico's.
              
            Does this hitherto hidden episode in the life of the murdered [man](Taylor)  bear
               any significance upon the crime?
               
            Was the woman's husband implacably determined to avenge himself upon
               the [man](Taylor)  who had won the affections of his wife?
              
            Was it the hand of the husband that fired the fatal bullet (from twelve
               to fourteen years old, according to the testimony of experts in ballistics)
               that killed [William Desmond Taylor](Taylor) ?
              
             ...At her home, Orienta Point, Mamaroneck, [Mrs. Robins](ethel) , former wife of
               the slain [director](Taylor) , yesterday refused to discuss this episode in the life of
               her former [husband](Taylor) .  [She](ethel)  refused to see [newspaper men](reporter)  but told a friend:
               "[I](ethel)  would do anything in my power to solve the mystery of [Mr. Tanner's](Taylor) 
               death but I do not think there can be any possible relation between this
               incident and the crime.  It was not until long after [Mr. Tanner's](Taylor) 
               disappearance that I learned definitely there was another woman in his life.
               "This information was placed in the hands of my attorney, [Mr. George
               Thoms](george) , and he brought a successful suit for divorce against Mr. Tanner.
               This was in the latter part of 1918 [sic].  At that time I did not know
               whether [Mr. Tanner](Taylor)  was dead or alive.
             
            "It was later, perhaps seven years ago, that I saw [Mr. Tanner](Taylor)  for the
               first time on the screen.  I cannot remember the name of the photoplay in
               which he appeared.  However, it was not until two and one-half years ago
               that I learned definitely that [William Desmond Taylor](Taylor)  was my former
               husband."
              
               February 14, 1922
               WASHINGTON TIMES
              
             New York, Feb. 14 -- Of the many screen stars he knew, some of whom
               have been thrown squarely into the spotlight by the unrelenting inquiry into
               his association with [William Desmond Taylor](Taylor) , slain director, mentioned but
               one--[Mary Miles Minter](minter) --in his letters to his nineteen-year-old [daughter](daughter) ,
               [Miss Ethel Daisy Deane-Tanner](daughter) .
              
             Disclosing this fact to a reporter today, [Miss Tanner](daughter)  and her mother,
               [Mrs. Edward L. C. Robins](ethel) , who live in Mamaroneck, both of whom were deserted
               by the man of mystery in 1908, said that [Miss Minter's](minter)  name was used by the
               [director](Taylor)  only in an impersonal way.
               
            [He](Taylor)  referred to [her](minter)  as an actress of ability, and said he had directed
               [her](minter)  in some of her photoplays.  This was one of the last letters written to
               his daughter by [Taylor](Taylor)  before he was murdered in his Los Angeles bungalow.
               [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  and her [daughter](daughter)  expressly asserted that the name of [Mabel
               Normand](mabel) , screen comedienne, and last person to see the director alive, did
               not appear in [Taylor's](Taylor)  letters to his [daughter](daughter) , which had been more or less
               frequent during the last two years.
               
            Curiously enough, (and one reason why [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  is increasingly
               inclined to the opinion that her husband's sudden disappearance from New
               York was due to loss of memory), her former husband never mentioned her in
               the letters.
              
            Another reason for this belief, she declared, was that on the times she
               and her [daughter](daughter)  lunched here with [Taylor](Taylor) --after it was definitely
               established that [Taylor](Taylor)  was in reality [Deane-Tanner](Taylor) --he never mentioned the
               fact that he deserted his [wife](ethel)  and daughter.  On these occasions all three
               felt the subject was rather delicate and it was never brought up.
               [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  said that when she and her [daughter](daughter)  became convinced two
               years ago, after seeing pictures of [Taylor](Taylor) , that he was the girl's father,
               [Miss Deane-Tanner](daughter)  took the initiative and wrote to him.  His reply came
               immediately.
            
            In it he said he was very glad to hear from her; that he had not heard
               from he for so long that he thought [she](daughter)  was dead.  This is one more reason
               why [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  believes her former [husband](Taylor)  was a victim of aphasia when he
               left, after attending the Vanderbilt cup races in 1908.
               Taylor also, Mrs. Robins asserted, was unable to recall friends of
               their married life, and when their names were mentioned, his face failed to
               show the slightest signs of remembrance.  He did remember, however, favorite
               dishes of his former wife when he was dining with his daughter, pointing
               them out to the latter on the menu during their luncheon together.
               [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  declared that these points proved that his mind, while
               vague as to consequential facts about [her](ethel)  married life with the [director](Taylor) ,
               retained minor details.
             
             The director's experiences in Alaska also were set forth in one letter.
               [Taylor](Taylor)  told of how he contracted scurvy, consequently suffering from loss of
               hair, headaches and neuralgia.  Another letter dismissed with a few scornful
               words [Sands](sands) , his chauffeur, who is still being sought by police.  The
               [director](Taylor)  declared [Sands](sands)  had upset his home and said his name had been forged
               to checks by his unfaithful servant.
              
            Signatures [Taylor](Taylor)  used in his letters to his [daughter](daughter) , for whom he
               showed deep devotion, were "[Father](Taylor) " and "[Daddy Pete](Taylor) ."  The origin of how
               [Taylor](Taylor)  came to be known as "[Pete](Taylor) " was explained by [Mrs. Robins](ethel) .  She said
               when [Taylor](Taylor) , or as he was known then, [Deane-Tanner](Taylor) , first came to live in
               New York he took lodging with several Englishmen.
             
               [Taylor](Taylor) , always deliberate and calculating in his methods, was nicknamed
               "[P. D. Q.](Taylor) ," by his roommates, which was quickly shortened to "[Pete](Taylor) ."
               The [director's](Taylor)  promise to leave his estate to his [daughter](daughter)  was
               contained in a letter written in February, 1920.  [Mrs. Robins](ethel)  said her
               former husband said in this message he thought it would be good policy to
               leave them both an annuity, in addition to telling of his will bequeathing
               his estate to [Ethel Daisy](daughter) .
              
               February 7, 1922
               NEW YORK AMERICAN
             
             [relating the testimony of [Taylor's](Taylor)  [wife](ethel)  during the divorce hearing in
               1911]...[Mrs. Tanner](ethel) , in her testimony, said she was married on
               December 7, 1901, at the Little Church Around the Corner.
               The ceremony was performed by [Rev. George C. Houghton](reverend) , pastor of the
               church.  Following the marriage the couple went to live at No. 40 Washington
               Square South, and later moved to the Hotel Colonial at Columbus Avenue and
               Eighty-first street, at which time her husband became associated with A. J.
               Crawford & Co., at No. 251 Fifth Avenue.
               [Mrs. Deane-Tanner](ethel)  added:
             
            "My husband left home at noon on October 23, 1908, and I have never
               seen him since.  The last word received from him was on October 26, 1908,
               when he was stopping at the Broadway Central Hotel.  He sent word to the
               Crawford firm asking for a sum of money.  This was sent to him by Daniel J.
               Barker, of the firm.  Then he disappeared."
