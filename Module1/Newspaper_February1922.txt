1922-02-02	...The police are not, however, basing their investigation now upon the theory that the thief was the slayer. Instead, they at present list it as a 'murder mystery.' THE SLAYER EVIDENTLY COMMITTED THE CRIME ABOUT NEAR 9 O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT. IT WAS AT THAT TIME THAT DOUGLAS MACLEAN, MOTION PICTURE ACTOR, AND HIS WIFE, WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR, SAY THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF THE PISTOL SHOT. Police also believe that the slaying occurred at that time because of the opinion expressed by the deputy coroner that the man had been dead for more than ten hours when the body was found. The last person who saw Taylor alive, with the exception of the assassin, was Miss Mabel Normand, film star. She visited him at his home last night. She arrived at the home shortly before 7 o'clock, she said. Her statement to Detectives Winn and Murphy follows: 'I had my chauffeur drive out to Mr. Taylor's home last evening, as we had a number of business matters to discuss. I should judge that I arrived there a little before 7 o'clock. It was while I was there that we again discussed the case of a man who had been in Mr. Taylor's employ and who stole from him. 'I asked Mr. Taylor what he intended doing with the man if he was captured--and he said that he would see that the man was prosecuted. We then discussed a certain scenario that I had written and a scenario that a friend of mine had written. 'While we were talking, William Peavey, Mr. Taylor's butler, was moving about in the two rooms. It was then, also, that Mr. Taylor told me that William was in some little trouble. He said that his servant had been arrested on a charge of vagrancy and that he had been forced to go down to the police station and deposit $200 bail for him. 'He said that he intended appearing in police court at a o'clock [sic] this afternoon and said he would do what he could to aid his servant if he was convinced that the man was not guilty. But he said that if Peavey had been guilty of doing any wrong that he would be forced to discharge him. 'After we had discussed a few other trifling matters Mr. Taylor asked me if I would remain and have dinner with him. I excused myself and told him that I must hurry to my home. He then asked me if he might visit me later that night and I told him I should be glad if he would come over to my home. He promised to call me on the telephone some time about 9 o'clock. 'Mr. Taylor then accompanied me from his house to my automobile. My chauffeur, William Davis, was seated in the machine and heard Mr. Taylor bid me good-night. Mr. Taylor and I were talking when I saw Peavey leave the house. He spoke to all of us and bid us good-night. We talked for a few minutes longer and Mr. Taylor turned and walked up toward his house and my machine moved away. I have not seen him since.' Davis, who lives at 1920 Las Palmas avenue, when questioned by the officers said the same story as did Miss Normand, and said that when they left there was no one moving about the yard that surrounds the house in which the tragedy occurred. It is evident, the detectives believe that Taylor after he entered the house sat down at once in front of his desk and that the assassin entered a few minutes later. The papers on the desk were mussed up and there were a large number of cancelled checks lying upon the desk. Miss Normand, in her statement to the police stated that the desk was in the same condition when she left the house, about 8 or 8:30 o'clock last night. It was at midnight that Miss Edna Purviance, who resides in the house adjoining Mr. Taylor's to the west, returned home. At that time, she said, she noticed that the lights were burning in Mr. Taylor's house. She went to the door, she said, and rang the bell and knocked upon the door. When she failed to secure a response she returned to her own home, believing Mr. Taylor probably had left the house after forgetting to turn off the electric light switch. At the time she was knocking upon the door the body of her friend was lying just behind the door and within a few feet of her. As detectives reconstruct the murder scene, they believe that the slayer opened the door a few minutes after Miss Normand had left, at the time Taylor was seated on a chair in front of the desk checking over the canceled checks. As Taylor half rose from his chair the slayer stepped into the room, and with pistol carefully aimed, pulled the trigger. The bullet entered the left breast just below the shoulder and ranged downward through the heart. Taylor fell over backward mortally wounded and probably died within a few seconds after he had been shot. But one shot was fired. The person who wielded the gun was evidently experienced in the handling of firearms and an excellent marksman. From the appearance of the wound it was evidently a .32 caliber pistol. The police believe that this was the caliber of the pistol because it made so little noise that the slayer was able to leave the house without attracting significant attention. When Peavey arrived and opened the house this morning all of the electric lights were burning just as they had been when Miss Purviance knocked at the door. Robbery was clearly not the motive of the crime. A purse containing $78 and a very valuable watch were found in the clothing on the body. There was no indication that any search had been made of the house for valuables and nothing was found to be missing when a careful check of the effects were made by Charles Eyton, manager of the Lasky studios and a close friend of the dead man. Charles Maigne, a friend of the dead man, told officers that he was positive that Taylor believed that sometime an enemy might return and do him harm. Douglas MacLean and his wife were having their supper in their home that also adjoins Taylor's house, but to the east, when they heard the sound of a shot. They place the time at about 9:30 or 9 o'clock in the statement they made to Detective Sergeants Wallis and Ziegler. Mrs. MacLean, however, told the officers that she noticed a man WALKING RAPIDLY DOWN THE WALK towards Taylor's home last evening shortly after Miss Normand left. She gave the following description of the man to officers: Height about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches, weight about 165 pounds. He had a muffler about his neck and was at the time wearing a plaid cap pulled over his eyes. She did not notice the clothing he was wearing and was unable to furnish the police with a better description because she says, she was unable to see distinctly at that hour of the night. 'I had, of course, no reason to be suspicious of that man at that time,' said Mrs. MacLean, when discussing the case with the two detective sergeants. 'But now I am convinced that he was the slayer. It was after I had seen him that my husband and I sat down to dinner. THAT WAS ABOUT 8:30 OR 9 O'CLOCK, I GUESS. 'We had just started our dinner when we heard a pistol shot. We did not investigate because we heard nothing further after that to arouse our suspicions and we thought that possibly the sound we heard then was that of an automobile backfiring in the street. Now, of course, we know that it was the shot that ended the life of Mr. Taylor.'
1922-02-02	William D. Taylor was a man of extreme courtesy; he talked little, and, apparently, he never forgot an acquaintance. I have seen him at work and at play, and he was always the same unostentatious, unassuming, quiet individual. When he did talk it was in a mild, melodious voice. No matter what the provocation on a set where he was directing a picture, he rarely if ever lost his temper. He addressed those under him with the same courtesy with which he conversed with those who wrote his contracts and paid his salary. ...It was always noticeable that he was extremely courteous to women working on his set, but he was never familiar. He would laugh and tell jokes and all that sort of thing, but he would not stand for any 'rough stuff' in any scenes he directed...
1922-02-02	With a gaping bullet wound in his left breast the body of William Desmond Taylor, one of the best known motion picture directors in the world, was found beside his desk in his home at 404 South Alvarado street, where he had fallen, the victim of an unknown assassin. The gruesome discovery was made by Henry Peavey of 127 1/2 East Third street, a negro, who was employed as a butler by Mr. Taylor, shortly after 8 o'clock this morning. Motion picture circles in Los Angeles and throughout the world were shocked by news of the slaying and hundreds of messages began pouring into Los Angeles asking for confirmation of the fact and for details of the slaying. Within a short time after the new murder mystery that is baffling the Los Angeles police department had been brought to light detectives began quizzing Miss Mabel Normand, Miss Edna Purviance and Douglas MacLean, all prominent in the motion picture world. After talking with these persons, Detective Sergeants Winn, Zeigler, Murphy and Wallis announced that a nation-wide search had been ordered for Edward F. Sands, who was formerly employed as a secretary by Taylor. It is believed Sands, who had an intimate knowledge of Taylor's movements and his associates, may assist the police in solving the murder. Six months ago Taylor returned to Los Angeles after a tour of Europe. Then he learned that a man he had employed had 'raised' a number of personal checks and had stolen many suits of his clothes. He reported the robbery to the police and charged that the man had secured many thousands of dollars by his illegal methods. A police search was being made for this man when Mr. Taylor's house was again entered and a number of suits and articles of jewelry were taken. It was after this second robbery that Mr. Taylor received a letter. It read: 'Dear Mr. Taylor--So sorry to inconvenience you, even temporarily; also observe the lesson of the forced sale of assets. (signed) 'Alias Jimmy V.' From Miss Normand and other persons the police learned that Mr. Taylor had often expressed fear that some time this man would return and do him bodily harm. The police are not, however, basing their investigation now upon the theory that the thief was the slayer. Instead, they at present list it as a 'murder mystery.' The slayer evidently committed the crime about near 9 o'clock last night. It was at that time that Douglas MacLean, motion picture actor, and his wife, who lived next door, say they heard the sound of the pistol shot. Police also believe that the slaying occurred at that time because of the opinion expressed by the deputy coroner that the man had been dead for more than ten hours when the body was found The last person who saw Taylor alive, with the exception of the assassin, was Miss Mabel Normand, film star. She visited him at his home last night. She arrived at the home shortly before 7 o'clock, she said. Her statement to Detectives Winn and Murphy follows: 'I had my chauffeur drive out to Mr. Taylor's home last evening, as we had a number of business matters to discuss.

'Mr. Taylor then accompanied me from his house to my automobile. My chauffeur, William Davis, was seated in the machine and heard Mr. Taylor bid me good-night. He spoke to all of us and bid us good-night. We talked for a few minutes longer and Mr. Taylor turned and walked up toward his house and my machine moved away. I have not seen him since.' Davis, who lives at 1920 Las Palmas avenue, when questioned by the officers said the same story as did Miss Normand, and said that when they left there was no one moving about the yard that surrounds the house in which the tragedy occurred. It is evident, the detectives believe that Taylor after he entered the house sat down at once in front of his desk and that the assassin entered a few minutes later. The papers on the desk were mussed up and there were a large number of canceled checks lying upon the desk.

There was no indication that any search had been made of the house for valuables and nothing was found to be missing when a careful check of the effects were made by Charles Eyton, manager of the Lasky studios and a close friend of the dead man. Charles Maigne, a friend of the dead man. told officers that he was positive that Taylor believed that sometime an enemy might return and do him harm. Douglas MacLean and his wife were having their supper in their home that also adjoins Taylor's house, but to the east, when they heard the sound of a shot. They place the time at about 9:30 or 9 o'clock in the statement they made to Detective Sergeants Wallis and Ziegler. Mrs. MacLean, however, told the officers that she noticed a man walking rapidly down the walk towards Taylor's home last evening shortly after Miss Normand left. She gave the following description of the man to officers: Height about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches, weight about 165 pounds. He had a muffler about his neck and was at the time wearing a plaid cap pulled over his eyes. She did not notice the clothing he was wearing and was unable to furnish the police with a better description because she says, she was unable to see distinctly at that hour of the night. 'I had of course, no reason to be suspicious of that man at that time,' said Mrs. MacLean, when discussing the case with the two detective sergeants. 'But now I am convinced that he was the slayer. It was after I had seen him that my husband and I sat down to dinner. That was about 8:30 or 9 o'clock, I guess. 'We had just started our dinner when we heard a pistol shot. We did not investigate because we heard nothing further after that to arouse our suspicions and we thought that possibly the sound we heard then was that of an automobile backfiring in the street. Now, of course, we know that it was the shot that ended the life of Mr. Taylor.' Mr. MacLean corroborated the statement made by his wife and the servant employed by the couple also told the officers that she plainly heard the shot while she was seated in the kitchen of the house. Mrs. C. F. Reddick of 410 A. South Alvarado street, who lives near by, told the police that she was awakened shortly after 1 o'clock last night by the sound of three shots. She said that she believed they came from the direction of the Taylor home. A systematic search of the neighborhood is being made by police in an effort to learn if any person or persons saw who last entered or left the Taylor home. They are also anxious to learn if any other persons in the neighborhood saw the man described by Mrs. MacLean loitering about and are anxious to secure a better description of the man. Detective Captain Dave Adams announced that he will run the assassin to earth if it becomes necessary to detail 20 detectives and a number of private investigators to the case. Upon the orders of Chief Deputy Coroner William McDonald the body was removed to the mortuary of the Ivy H. Overholtzer Undertaking Company, where an inquest will be held. The date of the inquest has not as yet been set, but it will probably be either Saturday or Monday, next, it is believed. Motion picture circles in Los Angeles were shocked when the first news of the murder reached them in an extra edition of the Evening Express. The blow was particularly felt at the Lasky studio; where Taylor was known to every actor, actress, property man and other employees. Immediately on receipt of the news work at the studios and on location ceased and men and women, their pallor showing through the grease paint of their makeups, gathered in knots to discuss the tragedy and speculate on what prompted the crime. Many theories were offered, among them revenge for fancied wrong, desire for gain and jealousy.
1922-02-02	NEGRO VALET SOBS STORY OF TRAGEDY '`Good night, Henry, good night,' he said to me when I left him yesterday,' said Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored valet, between sobs as he told of the tragedy that ended the life of his beloved employer last night. '`Good night, Mr. Taylor,' I said to him, and that's the last I saw of him until I opened the door this morning and found his dead body, his feet stretching toward me on the floor.' The negro broke into soft sobs and then declared passionately: 'I wish I could get the man that did it. I'd go to jail for the rest of my life if I could get him.' As Peavey talked, he was taking some white cloths clotted with blood from a wire paper basket and placing them in the court incinerator. 'His blood,' the negro said, pathetically. 'We just used the cloths to clean up the room.' 'Mr. Taylor was the most wonderful man I ever worked for and I don't see how anybody would want to kill him. I have been with him six months.' Peavey said that he came to Taylor's apartment early today, intending to go through the usual round of his duties. 'I was going to fix his bath water for him,' said the valet, 'and then give him his dose of medicine. After that I was going to fix his breakfast--a couple of boiled eggs, some toast and a glass of orange juice. 'WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR I SAW HIM LYING THERE STRETCHED OUT ON THE FLOOR, HIS FEET TOWARD ME AND THE FLOOR ALL BLOODY. 'I turned and screamed and the landlord came rushing in.' Peavey said he lived at 127 1/2 Third Street. 'I have not been staying with Taylor during the night, but have been sleeping in my room.' Peavey's theory was that somebody slipped into the open door of Taylor's apartment when Taylor took Mabel Normand to her car late last night, and shot him from ambush inside the room.
1922-02-02	Mary Miles Minter Heartbroken Tears streaming down here pretty face, Mary Miles Minter, famous motion picture star, hurried to the door of the Taylor bungalow at noon today and asked brokenly: 'It isn't true, is it?' 'Taylor is dead,' said Detective Sergeant H. J. Wallis. 'Oh my God, I can't believe it,' Miss Minter cried in despair. She turned in her grief to her mother, who had accompanied her to the bungalow court in her automobile. 'And I saw him only yesterday,' she said. 'His car passed mine at Seventh and Alvarado--it was the first time I knew it was gray.'
1922-02-02	New clues were discovered late this afternoon that may lead to a solution of the mysterious murder of William Desmond Taylor, 35, noted movie director, found shot through the back, in his apartment, 404-B South Alvarado street, this morning. New developments were: 1. Taylor had a premonition that death was near, and related his fear to Mrs. J. M. Berger, income tax expert. 'If anything happens,' he told her yesterday afternoon, 'look out for my affairs.' 2. Mysterious phone calls and anonymous letters were received by Taylor. He told Mrs. Berger that for three weeks someone had been attempting to find out if Taylor was in his apartment. When Taylor answered, the person would hang up immediately.3. Taylor was engaged in a telephone call that evidently worried him, when Mabel Normand called at his apartments at 7:15 p.m. yesterday.4. Taylor is reported to have told Charles Maigne, a friend, that he feared unknown persons, who invaded his apartments while he was absent, walked on his bed with dusty shoes, and left gold-tipped cigarette stubs. Detectives late today said they were unable to find a single trace of Edward F. Sands, former valet of Taylor's charged with robbing Taylor. Warrants were issued weeks ago for Sands. Police want to question him. Mabel Normand, this afternoon, was confined to her home from nervous breakdown. She is said to be a dear friend of Taylor. Taylor's body was found sprawled in front of his writing desk, by Harry [sic] Peavey, colored man-servant. He was evidently shot from behind. The bullet took an upward course, entering his body near the left kidney. Powder burns were evident. The bullet lodged underneath the right shoulder. Death was instantaneous. Mabel Normand, the motion picture star, is believed to have been the last person to see Taylor alive. Officers say that she had discussed a scenario with the Famous Players-Lasky director early last evening before the colored valet had left, and that Taylor had conducted her to a waiting auto in the street. Peavey, the valet, who left the house at about the same time, said that Taylor had left the front door of the apartment open, and it is assumed that the murderer entered and concealed himself, shooting down his victim as he returned. Peavey discovered Taylor's body, lying as it fell, with a chair athwart the legs, and rushed in a frenzy of fear to rouse the neighbors. One of the first to arrive at the murder house was E. C. Jessurun, owner of the bungalow court in which Taylor lived. He said he heard a shot last night, but paid no attention to it, as he thought it was an automobile backfiring. The noise was also heard by Mrs. Douglas MacLean, movie actress, living in one of the court bungalows. 'When I entered the room,' Jessurun said, 'it was in absolutely good condition, indicating no struggle. 'Taylor was lying in front of his desk, the blood all over his face. 'It would have been impossible for him to have been shot by anyone outside of the bungalow. Whoever did it was inside Taylor's room. 'As I remember, a light was burning all night in the Taylor apartment.' Charles Eyton, manager of the Famous Players-Lasky company, said that to his knowledge Taylor did not have an enemy in the world. Money to the amount of $78.20 was found in Taylor's pockets. Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean, motion picture stars, who live next door to Taylor, said they heard a shot fired about 8:30. Mrs. MacLean said she opened the door and saw a man leaving Taylor's residence. She got no description of him. Mrs. C. F. Reddick, who lives in a house across the courtyard from the motion picture director, said she heard three shots fired about 2 a.m. One bullet, however, had struck Taylor. It entered his left side immediately below the heart and death was caused by hemorrhage. Other neighbors, when they heard the shot, were not sure it was a revolver shot. They listened but heard no further commotion, so came to the conclusion that it must have been the exhaust of an automobile. Taylor's body was removed to the Harvey-Overholtzer undertaking parlors where a complete examination will be made to determine from just what angle the fatal shot was fired. Not a thing in the well-furnished house was disturbed. Peavey said that everything was just as he had left it when he went home at 7 o'clock last night. Taylor was one of the best known, best liked motion picture directors in the game today. Many prominent stars of the film world gathered at his home. Taylor lived alone at the modest apartment where he had been for the past three years. Here, neighbors say, he practically immersed himself in his art, occasionally entertaining friends. About the walls of his workshop living room hang scores of autographed photos of famous movie folk, his intimates and associates. The apartment is on two floors. Upstairs are the bedrooms where Taylor, on his dressing table, kept a loaded revolver. The weapon was found lying on the dresser this morning. Charles Eyton, manager of the Famous Players-Lasky company, said that no stone would be left unturned to run his murderer to earth. It is believed that the only man who had a grudge against the director was Edward Sands. Taylor is said by the police to have had incriminating evidence against Sands in connection with the robbery of his house several months ago. Sands is said to have formerly been a butler to the motion picture man and is now being hunted for burglary. Detective Sergeant Zeigler, said that among the effects found untouched in the house was jewelry, which he declares was taken by Sands, the former butler, and returned from Stockton, from which point Sands had sent the pawn tickets with a sarcastic note. Miss Normand said that when she left, Taylor told her that he would call her as soon as she reached her home, but when he did not call, she began to wonder what was the matter. The police believe that the murder was perpetrated more for revenge or as it had been pointed out, to prevent Taylor telling what he knew of the burglary.
1922-02-02	Mabel Normand, the last person known to have seen William D. Taylor arrive, arrived at Taylor's home last night at approximately 7 o'clock, she said. He had just finished dinner and was talking over the telephone, as Miss Normand came in. Taylor's valet let her in the door and in a few moments Taylor said 'good-bye' on the telephone and came out and spoke to Miss Normand. For the next 45 minutes the actress and Taylor sat discussing scenarios and a book which the director had purchased that day from a department store as a gift for Miss Normand. He had phoned her at her home earlier in the afternoon, requesting her to call at his home for the book. Miss Normand was at her bank earlier in the afternoon and had phoned her home, receiving Taylor's message to the effect that he had already sent her one book from a book store, but had got the book that she wanted at a department store, and requested her to stop at his apartment on her way home to pick up the book. The Sennett star left Taylor at 7:45 and arrived home by 8 o'clock, she asserted. When she left Taylor's home, he escorted her to her car and in the presence of her chauffeur, bade her good night. When Miss Normand arrived at Taylor's residence he had just finished dinner and his valet was clearing the table, she said. Completing this work, he said good night and left. He was seen talking to Miss Normand's chauffeur for about five minutes afterward. Miss Normand arrived home at approximately 8 o'clock and retired to her room, where at about 8:15 she had dinner served in bed. The first information the star received of Taylor's death was at 7:30 this morning, when Miss Edna Purviance phoned her and informed her that Taylor's negro valet, who had just opened the door to enter the house, came running into the yard, screaming. The light in the house, Miss Purviance informed Miss Normand, had been burning all night. Taylor had asked Miss Normand if he could not take her to dinner. Miss Normand replied 'no,' she was tired and was going home to eat dinner and retire early. Taylor promised to call Miss Normand within an hour. He never called her.
1922-02-02	Just a cocktail shaker, and besides it two stemmed glasses with sediment of orange juice and gin in the bottom, and two half-buried cigarettes on the tray. That was the only evidence of sociability that marked the last hour of William D. Taylor's spectacular film career. This morning the remnant of Taylor's hospitality stood out as the only trace of disorder in his magnificent bachelor apartments at 404B South Alvarado street. Except where his huge body fell across the highly polished floor, with a big arm chair toppling over him. The bewitching smiles, frowns and pensive moods of beautiful Mary Miles Minter, film star, gazed from various photographs around the walls of his living room. If those pictures could speak, the assassin who shot Taylor from the back could be vividly described. From a secluded corner, Mary Pickford's autographed likeness beamed its friendship for the popular director. America's most popular star had written her appreciation of Taylor's patience in directing her. Taylor was a man of discriminating taste as to the furnishings of his apartments. A few choice vases, a leather bound set of Encyclopedia Brittanica in a small bookcase, a few choice ivory carved ornaments on his piano, an expensive oriental rug--that was about all that adorned his living room, except-- Taylor, the man, was for business first. There was no mistaking that part of his nature. His tiny mahogany desk, which was placed against the front of the house, was littered with letters, canceled checks and bills. That he lived to himself was noted by the many personal things that surrounded him. He was a man of modest taste. Even though he was rich and his house luxuriously furnished, there was no sign of extravagance, gaudiness or show about his abode. A copy of Floyd Dells' 'Moon Calf,' with a hand-painted ribbon marking his progress in the popular story, was on a stand by the piano. The dining-room was orderly, save where the police had been forced to move the blood-stained rugs through from the living room. Strange were the stories told about Taylor today--while his lifeless body was being moved to the Ivy Overholtzer undertaking parlor. He was tall, handsome, charming to meet--that is, if one was fortunate enough to meet him. But he was mysterious of habits. He was quiet, unobtrusive and never entertained women in his bachelor apartments alone. Four years he had lived in the severe, cold-looking colonial apartment court. Four years he had been there, but in that time he was unknown to others who lived there. He seldom entertained. And when he did--his visitors left at a reasonable hour. They were always quiet, just like himself. And when he had work to do, Taylor would not answer the doorbell, the telephone, but would stay locked in his apartment, until everything was finished. It was just his manner. Likewise--he did not believe in 'wild parties' at his home. In the four years he had lived at the place he had entertained upon three memorable occasions, and there were crowds, chaperons, and the parties broke up early. And they tell how very inconspicuously he dressed. Always he was well groomed--that is what those who were fortunate enough to get a glimpse of the man say--but never what was called 'a fashion plate.' He hadn't been home of evenings lately much--because the light in his living room had been out. That was the way neighbors knew that the popular director was about. Taylor was silent about his business affairs. He discussed them with nobody. He kept his own counsel, just as he preferred to live alone. His heart affairs were also seldom discussed. But that Miss Minter was very popular with the dead man was discerned by the fact that her telephone number led the list in the directory in his telephone booth. Likewise, other film favorites had their place in his calling list, but his name has not been linked with any of them, although he was known as an eligible bachelor. Were his thoughts on Mabel Normand when Taylor went to his mysterious death? She had been his guest in the evening. At 8:30 o'clock he saw her to her car. He returned, locked the door and stood at his desk ready to resume work. Just above his work, pinned to the lacy draperies on the window, was the somewhat pouty, impudent, but adorable face of Mabel Normand--looking at him. But who killed William D. Taylor?
1922-02-02	Deputy Public Administrator L. P. Waterman took charge of the murdered Wm. D. Taylor's personal effects late this morning. These included recent letters from Ethel Daisy Taylor, daughter of the deceased, living at Mamaraneck, New York. Judging from their contents, the daughter is in her 'teens and attending a finishing school. According to Waterman, Taylor had been working on his income tax some time during the evening. An itemized account of his income, which gave the total at $38,000 a year was found by Waterman. The high literary tastes of the deceased motion picture director are revealed by the books piled on the table at which Taylor had been at work when he was shot. These included John Maysefield's 'Collected Poems,' John Galsworthy's 'In Chancery,' Knut Hamsun's 'Dreamers,' Gorky's 'Stories of the Steppe,' John Dos Passos' 'Three Soldiers,' Conrad Aiken's 'Punch' and Eunice Tietjens' 'Profiles from China.' On the fly leaf of each of these books, their owner had written 'Wm. D. Taylor.' The theory of Frank O'Connor, formerly an assistant director under Taylor and now director for Marshal Neilan, is that he was shot by a person kneeling. He pointed out that the bullet entered the body rather low on the left side and made its way upward in a slanting direction to a point beneath the right shoulder. O'Conner insisted that this theory was supported by the fact that Taylor's clothing was burned and there were powder marks on his flesh. He had been dead about 10 hours, according to the information received by O'Connor. Taylor had been working on a part for a woman star in a new Lasky production during the afternoon, according to friends. 'I left him talking over one of those books with Miss Normand at about 7 o'clock,' said Harry Peavey, his colored valet. ''Anything more you want?'' I asked him,' Peavey said he inquired of Taylor. 'He told me he didn't and I went home.'
1922-02-02	Good night, Henry good night,' he said to me when I left him yesterday,' said Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored valet between sobs as he told of the tragedy that ended the life of his beloved employer last night. ''Good night, Mr. Taylor,' I said to him, and that's the last I saw of him until I opened the door this morning and found his dead body, his feet stretching toward me on the floor.' The negro broke into soft sobs and then declared passionately: 'I wish I could get the man that did it. I'd go to jail for the rest of my life if I could get him.' As Peavey talked, he was taking some white cloths clotted with blood from a wire paper basket and placing them in the court incinerator. 'His blood,' the negro said pathetically. 'We just used the cloths to clean up the room.' 'Mr. Taylor was the most wonderful man I ever worked for and I don't see how anybody would want to kill him. I have been with him six months.' Peavey said that he came to Taylor's apartment early today, intending to go through the usual round of his duties. 'I was going to fix his bath water for him.' said the valet, 'and then give him his dose of medicine. After that I was going to fix his breakfast-- a couple of boiled eggs, some toast and a glass of orange juice. 'When I opened the door I saw him lying there stretched out on the floor, his feet toward me and the floor all bloody. 'I turned and screamed and the landlord came rushing in.' Peavey said he lived at 127 1/2 Third Street. 'I have not been staying with Taylor during the night, but have been sleeping in my room.' Peavey's theory was that somebody slipped into the open door of Taylor's apartment when Taylor took Mabel Normand to her car late last night, and shot him from ambush inside the room.
1922-02-02	Tears streaming down here pretty face, Mary Miles Minter, famous motion picture star, hurried to the door of the Taylor bungalow at noon today and asked brokenly: 'It isn't true, is it?' 'Taylor is dead,' said Detective Sergeant H. J. Wallis. 'Oh my God, I can't believe it,' Miss Minter cried in despair. She turned in her grief to her mother, who had accompanied her to the bungalow court in her automobile. 'And I saw him only yesterday,' she said. 'His car passed mine at Seventh and Alvarado--it was the first time I knew it was gray.' Miss Minter was one of the chief mourners at the Undertaking parlors of the Ivy Overholtzer company, where Taylor's body was taken. Miss Minter was leaning upon the arm of her grandmother. The star cried and offered to do anything she could to aid police in solving the mystery. Kathlyn Williams, cinema star, and wife of Charlie Eyton, general manager of Famous-Players Lasky company, was also a visitor at the undertakers to view the body. Robert [sic] O'Conner, director under Taylor, called at the undertaking parlors also. Many telephone calls have been received at the funeral parlors regarding the case. Inquest over the body of the motion picture director will probably be held early Saturday morning. No funeral arrangements have been made. Police have not located the relatives of the deceased man.
1922-02-02	Detectives seeking a solution to the mysterious slaying of William Desmond Taylor are considering the following theories: 1--A woman, jealous of a rival, killed him. 2--A jealous woman sent a hired assassin or an infatuated admirer to kill him. 3--A jealous suitor of a woman who favored Taylor killed him. 4--A forger killed him to destroy evidence of his crime from among the checks Taylor was sorting. 5--A robber slipped into the house and, surprised by Taylor's return, killed him and fled because he feared to stop for loot. 6--A former servant accused by him of criminal acts killed him for revenge. 7--An aspirant for movie honors, rejected by Taylor, killed him. 8--A woman, to make sure Taylor never would reveal her secret, killed him or had him killed. The investigators, weighing all the evidence, incline to one of the first three possibilities.
1922-02-03	Star Talks of Slain Man 'No, I never was engaged to marry William Desmond Taylor, I regret to say.' This statement was made by pretty Mary Miles Minter in an interview at her home last night. 'Do you know where his ex-wife and daughter are?' Miss Minter was asked. Miss Minter's violet colored eyes flashed fire. 'Why he had no wife--he was never married. I'm positive of that,' she replied. 'But, maybe Mary, he didn't tell you he was married,' broke in Mother, Charlotte Shelby. 'But mother, I knew him so well--I am sure he wasn't married. I asked him if he was, and he told me no.'
1922-02-03	Mr. Taylor was a man who knew everything,' said Miss Normand. 'If I wanted to know the meaning of an unusual word I did not have to take the trouble to look it up in the dictionary. I just had my secretary telephone Mr. Taylor.'
1922-02-03	Detectives today were known to be quietly seeking a young New York broker, whose identity is being kept secret, to question him in an effort to bring to light more facts about the murder. This young man is said to have been prominent in movie society. He is described as a friend of a prominent movie actress. ...Detectives gave no intimation of what light they believed he might possibly shed on the mysterious slaying.
1922-02-03	VALET TELLS OF FINDING BODY There were tears on the cheek of Henry Peavey, colored, who for six months had been employed as William Desmond Taylor's valet, as he told the story yesterday of how he discovered the murdered man's body upon entering the apartment yesterday morning. The night before, when Peavey left to go to his own home, Taylor called a cheery, 'Good night, Henry.' 'I can hear his voice yet,' said this humble mourner. 'It was the kind of strong, friendly voice that made a man feel good.' And then he burst out, 'I'd be willing to go to jail for the rest of my life if I could get the man that did it.' The valet was at his last task for the master; he was wiping up the blood from the floor, but his sobs shook him at times so that he could not proceed. 'I've worked for a lot of men,' he went on, 'but Mr. Taylor was the most wonderful of all of them. I came here this morning intending to fix his bath and get his breakfast, which I always does. And before the bath I'd bring him a dose of medicine. It was always just the same--for breakfast two soft- boiled eggs, toast and a glass of orange juice. 'And having it in my mind to make everything just as nice as I could, knowing he would be pleased and say a kind word, I opened the door. 'AND THEN I FOUND HIM STRETCHED OUT ON THE FLOOR, WHICH WAS ALL BLOODY AND HIS FEET TOWARD THE DOOR. 'And then I backed to the door, pretty near overcome with horror, and yelled for the landlord. The way I figure it is that somebody slipped in last night when Mr. Taylor took Miss Normand to the car and shot him from hiding. But how could any one kill such a man as he was?' Peavey lives at 127 1/2 East Third street. His habit was to reach the Taylor apartment before breakfast and leave after dinner.
1922-02-03	[from an interview with Julia Crawford Ivers]...Mrs. Ivers then told of the difficulty Mr. Taylor said he had with his valet-secretary, Sands. 'There never was a more devoted man serving another than this man Sands during the first year and a half of his service for Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor trusted him with everything. '...Sands read everything he could find. He used to study into the late hours of the night and when Mr. Taylor told me of the various actions attributed to Sands, we all decided the man must have become deranged...'
1922-02-03	Phone Used To Badger Taylor Mysterious telephone calls in the dark hours of the night foreshadowed the murder of William D. Taylor. This important information was given last night by Julia Crawford Ivers, for eight years scenario writer for the slain man and a close associate of his in the film industry. 'A few weeks before Christmas Mr. Taylor told us at the studio that he was considerably annoyed and mystified by telephone calls late at night. He said he would answer the phone only to find there was no one at the other end of the wire when he responded,' Mrs. Ivers said. 'These calls kept on coming at regular intervals, always with the same results. Mr. Taylor said he had not the slightest idea who was calling him or what the purpose was.' Harry Fellows, Mr. Taylor's assistant, confirmed the story. Mr. Taylor told him of these phone calls, he said. ...Mrs. Marjorie Berger said that Mr. Taylor had told her often that he had been getting mysterious phone calls. He talked so funny saying that he had wished sometimes that he had dropped prosecution [of Sands]. Mrs. Berger said: 'Why don't you get somebody to watch [your home]?' But he said, 'Oh, no.'
1922-02-03	...Peavey said that Taylor was bothered very often by telephone calls. He would answer the phone and the party who called would hang up.
1922-02-03	Officers last night were concentrating their efforts on locating a mysterious desperado who is sought as the slayer of William Desmond Taylor, one of the best known directors in the motion picture world, who was found murdered at his bungalow home of 404-B South Alvarado street yesterday morning. The officers were diligently following the trail of the mysterious man after they learned that several times the strange nocturnal visitor had been driven away by Taylor at the point of a gun. But two weeks ago, the investigators said Taylor found this man trying to gain entrance to the bungalow by means of a bedroom window. The window was half open and Taylor is said to have driven him away. Many times the murdered director is said to have heard unusual noises about the house and upon investigation found the unwelcome visitor prowling about the building or premises, but each time Taylor flourished a gun and drove him away. And then again, the police say in trying to weave a chain of incriminating evidence about the hunted man, Taylor received telephone calls which brought forth no response when he answered. It is believed the calls came from this person who was ascertaining if any one was at home at the bungalow. It was within half an hour after Mabel Normand, famous screen actress, and Taylor had a chat early Wednesday evening that he was killed, the police believe. They are also trying to run down clews which they say have found and which indicate that jealousy or revenge was the motive. They are inclined to believe that the former is the possible solution of the death. That a man committed the crime is based upon information furnished by Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of the film star, who lives next door to the Taylor home, and by her maid. They say they saw a mysterious man at the Taylor home before and after the murder. A .38 caliber steel-nose bullet caused Taylor's death. This was determined and the bullet found when Autopsy Surgeon Wagner performed a post mortem on the body early last night. The bullet had penetrated the back beneath the left shoulder blade, pierced the heart and then took a right upward course into the neck, where it lodged. While three theories are being considered by the police, certain material clews developed late yesterday lead them to believe that behind the tragedy is the shadow of a woman. The partly told story of Taylor's murder is this: At 6:45 Wednesday night he ate dinner in his little bungalow court home. He was alone. His servant was the only other person in the house. Shortly after 7 o'clock, Miss Mabel Normand. famous screen star, and whose engagement to the slain man had been generally rumored for many months but, denied by her, went to the Taylor home. She remained according to her story to the police, until about 7:45 o'clock. She had called for the purpose of obtaining a book that Taylor desired her to read. When she left, Taylor escorted her to her automobile, waiting at the entrance to the bungalow court. When Taylor departed from the house with Miss Normand he left the door open. What happened? The servant, Henry Peavey, a negro who has been with Taylor for about six months, said Miss Normand and Taylor were together in the living room when he left to go to his own home about 7:20 o'clock. Yesterday morning, as was his custom, he arrived to prepare breakfast at 7:30 o'clock. He had a key to the front door and opened it. He started to go in and then noticed Taylor lying on his back with his feet near the door. The servant did not enter. When Taylor faded to answer his alarmed cries he rushed to the home of a neighbor and called the police. Some time between 7:45 o'clock and 7:55 o'clock the night before, Taylor had been shot. Here are the theories on which police detectives are concentrating their efforts. Taylor was shot by-- 1. A woman he had scorned or whom he had enraged. 2. A discarded suitor of some woman with whom he had been friendly. 3. A burglar who was surprised by Taylor when he returned to the house after escorting Miss Normand to her car. Among the clews being followed by the police is one furnished by employees at the Morosco Theater, who stated that several weeks ago a man inquired for Taylor's address and by his insistence and strange actions aroused their suspicions. The officers are trying to locate this individual, who would not take 'no' for an answer to his questions as to where the director resided. A former secretary whom Taylor had caused to be arrested for forgery and who is said to have threatened his life, is being sought for information he may be able to give bearing on the case. Taylor is known to have been friendly with many women. He is said to have been a man of charming personality and of considerable magnetism. Outside of one particular prominent woman he was not known, say police, to have been particularly interested in any one. It is possible, say police, that some man, enamored of any one of the women with whom Taylor might have been on friendly terms, could have become enraged, waited his opportunity at the Taylor home, and then killed Taylor from ambush. Every possible angle of Taylor's private life is now being investigated by the detectives in connection with the first two theories. That the second will prove to be correct the officers believe. This belief is based on what Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of a motion picture director, residing in the house next to that of Taylor, saw. At 7:10, according to Mrs. MacLean's maid, Mr. and Mrs. MacLean sat down to dinner. While the second course was being served the maid claims to have heard footsteps of a man in a rear alley running between the two houses. She commented upon it to her employers, but thought nothing of it until she heard of the murder yesterday morning. At 7:50 o'clock, six minutes after Miss Normand left with Taylor to go to her machine, Mrs. MacLean heard a shot and went to her door. A man was just leaving the Taylor home. He was not Sands, the valet. Mrs. MacLean is sure of this, she says. She knew Sands. When she saw the man he was just stepping through the door. He turned half-way around, glanced back through the door and then pulled it shut. He saw her, she says, as she stood watching him, but did not show any alarm. She closed her door just as he started away from the Taylor home. He walked, she declared, not out to Alvarado street to the main entrance, but disappeared through the alley leading between Taylor's house and hers. The mysterious visitor was large of stature. wore dark rough clothing and had a muffler and cap on. She could not see his face. This man, the police believe, is the murderer. They believe it was he whom the MacLean's maid heard as she was serving dinner. It is probable, they think, that he was acquainted with Taylor's habits. Friends say that Taylor left the door open when he left his home for a few minutes. The mysterious visitor is believed to have secreted himself around the corner of the house and watched until Taylor came out with Miss Normand. As the two walked toward the film star's car, the assassin probably hurried into the house through the door left open by his victim. When Taylor was found his body was lying with the head toward the east wall, directly in front of a writing desk. The feet were near the door, the legs outstretched. He was on his back. It is the police theory that when he returned to the house after bidding Miss Normand good night he sat down at the desk to work. An open check book was lying on the desk, a pen nearby, when the murder was discovered. The murderer, waiting behind a pillar in the room, stepped out when he believed Taylor to be settled in the chair and fired. The bullet entered below the left shoulder blade and penetrated the heart. Taylor died instantly, pitched forward and in failing upset the chair. The chair was found lying across his legs when the body was discovered. Intimate friends say that it was the one used by Taylor at his desk. The murderer is then believed to have hurried to the door, glanced back just as Mrs. MacLean discovered him and then fled through the alley. When Peavey, the servant, saw the body of his dead master, as he opened the front door yesterday morning, screaming into the bungalow court yard, Mrs. Verne Dumas, who heard his cries, called the police. Detectives who responded made a casual examination, but did not turn the body over until Coroner Nance reached the scene. The first report issued from the headquarters was that Taylor had died of natural of causes. As soon as it became known that the director had been murdered Detective Captain David Adams assigned every available officer to the case. Officials from the public administrator's office were sent to the house and took charge of the dead man's personal effects. Thousands of dollars worth of jewels were found in his bedroom. A half completed income tax blank lying on the desk showed his annual income to be $37,000. Coroner Nance ordered the body sent to the undertaking parlors of Ivy Overholtzer on South Flower street and detectives then began the work of running down the murderer. According to Peavey, the servant, his murdered master had no enemies that he knew of nor had he had any difficulty with any guest that had visited the house while he was present. When he left for the night Wednesday, Taylor seemed to be in high spirits and was conversing in an animated manner with Miss Normand. Police are convinced that the servant can throw no light on the mystery. Miss Normand told Detective Sergeants Wallace and Ziegler that she had gone to two jewelry stores downtown before she went to Taylor's home. They were closed and after buying some peanuts from a vendor at Seventh street and Broadway and a copy of the Police Gazette she hurried to Taylor's home. Her story and that of her chauffeur, William Davis, coincide. Miss Normand claims that she left the Taylor home about 7:45 o'clock, and that the director walked with her to the machine, leaving, as was his custom, the door open behind him. When they reached the car, she says, her chauffeur had been reading the magazine. He hastily threw it aside and Taylor saw it. The couple had been discussing literature and he chided her good naturedly about reading that type of magazine. She says that after she left Taylor at the curbing she immediately returned to her home. While in Taylor's home she had discussed with Taylor a certain charge made against his negro servant involving social vagrancy. Miss Normand was informed by motion picture friends of the tragedy soon after the body was discovered. She refused to receive callers outside of headquarters officers and close intimate friends. To further the theory that Taylor was killed by some one other than his former valet, police point to a story told by a guest in the Dumas home, near by, who claims that on last Monday night early he saw two men go up to the door of the Taylor home, try the door with a key and then walk away. One of these men is believed to have been the murderer. Several others in the block beside Mr. and Mrs. MacLean claim to have heard the fatal shot. E. C. Jessurum, owner of the court, who was ill in bed heard it and called it to the attention of his wife. who was reading to him. Not hearing a second shot, they thought nothing of the interruption. One of the first visitors at the Taylor home after police detectives had taken charge was Mary Miles Minter, mutual friend of Miss Normand and the murdered man. Friends had informed her of the tragedy. Accompanied by her mother, she hurried to the Taylor home, but was met at the door by Detective Sergeant Hermann Cline, who briefly told her what had happened. She became hysterical and it was several minutes before she could talk coherently. She said that Taylor had directed her in three pictures and that she considered him an intimate friend. She knew of no enemies that might have sought his death, she said. 'Why, he was a wonderful man,' she added, 'and every one that knew him loved him.' This sentiment was voiced too, by her mother. Miss Minter said that the last time she saw Taylor was Wednesday afternoon, when she met him at the corner of Seventh and Alvarado streets. That Taylor had a premonition of his death and told several friends was learned last night. According to Mrs. J. M. Berger, income tax specialist, who is at present engaged by Miss Normand, the murdered man told her Wednesday afternoon that 'he felt that something was going to happen to him.' They laughed the subject away, though, and apparently Taylor forgot it. He told the same thing to other persons--friends in the motion picture colony, but all ridiculed the idea. The house in which Taylor was found is lavishly furnished. The lower floor consists of a living room, dining room and kitchen. Upstairs, with the stairway leading from the dining room, are two bedrooms. One of these rooms was used by Taylor to sleep in. The other was reserved as a guest chamber. Photographs, all of them affectionately autographed, of famous stars, whom Taylor had directed are the most conspicuous decorations in the living room. These include one of Mary Pickford, who describes Taylor as 'the most patient man I ever knew.' A search of the house by detectives and the deputy police administrator revealed a large quantity of expensive bonded liquors. This was taken charge of together with his other personal effects. Late yesterday afternoon Detective Captain Adams assigned Detectives Sergeants Hermann Cline, Murphy and Winn to the case. The detectives, after interviewing Miss Normand's chauffeur, admitted that the case is one of the most baffling that has confronted the Los Angeles department for many years. Sands, the former valet being sought, is said to be in Los Angeles, and several friends of Taylor told police last night that they had seen him. Every officer has been furnished with his description and given orders to arrest him on sight. Police are not yet ready, they say, to implicate him in the murder, but he is the one known man who would have a motive for desiring Taylor's death, and his explanation of where he was on the night of the murder is anxiously awaited by officers. If he is innocent, they believe, despite felony warrant already issued for him, he will surrender rather than take the chance of being accused of suspicion of murder by remaining in hiding.
1922-02-03	Miss Edna Purviance, who lived in the two-story bungalow adjoining the home of William D. Taylor, the Lasky film director who was shot Wednesday night, said that when she returned to her home some time near midnight Wednesday she noticed lights burning in Mr. Taylor's house, but that as Mr. Taylor was given to burning the midnight oil, being a great reader, she thought nothing of it. 'I was awakened,' said Miss Purviance last night, 'early Thursday morning by the terrifying voice of some one who seemed to be running up and down the court, screaming, 'Mr. Taylor is dead! Mr. Taylor is dead!' I looked out the window and saw his negro boy Henry, who was almost frantic with grief, as he was very much attached to Mr. Taylor. 'Before they found the bullet wound in Mr. Taylor's back they thought he had died of heart disease, and that seemed terrible enough, but when we learned he had been murdered, almost at our own door, it seemed too horrible to believe. 'I knew Mr. Taylor only very slightly. I had never worked with him and had only met him to a purely formal social way. I thought him to be a very interesting, likable, discerning gentleman, with gallant, polished manners and a brilliant intellect. 'I always heard him spoken of as a man with a reputation above reproach and a nature that was kind and generous. Although living as a near neighbor, I saw him very infrequently and knew nothing of his private life or of his love affairs, if he had any. I knew that he and Miss Normand were good friends but knew nothing of heart interest on either side.'
1922-02-03	There were tears on the cheek of Henry Peavey, colored, who for six months had been employed as William Desmond Taylor's valet, as he told the story yesterday of how he discovered the murdered man's body upon entering the apartment yesterday morning. The night before, when Peavey left to go to his own home, Taylor called a cheery, 'Good night, Henry.' 'I can hear his voice yet,' said this humble mourner. 'It was the kind of strong, friendly voice that made a man feel good.' And then he burst out, 'I'd be willing to go to jail for the rest of my life if I could get the man that did it.' The valet was at his last task for the master; he was wiping up the blood from the floor, but his sobs shook him at times so that he could not proceed. 'I've worked for a lot of men,' he went on, 'but Mr. Taylor was the most wonderful of all of them. I came here this morning intending to fix his bath and get his breakfast, which I always does. And before the bath I'd bring him a dose of medicine. It was always just the same--for breakfast two soft- boiled-eggs, toast, and a glass of orange juice. 'And having it in my mind to make everything just as nice as I could, knowing he would be pleased and say a kind word, I opened the door. 'And then I found him stretched out on the floor, which was all bloody and his feet toward the door. 'And then I backed to the door, pretty near overcome with horror, and yelled for the landlord.

Peavey lives at 127 1/2 East Third street. His habit was to reach the Taylor apartment before breakfast and leave after dinner.
1922-02-03	All the picture studios in Los Angeles were in mourning yesterday. The mysterious murder of William Desmond Taylor shocked the entire motion picture colony and held the focus of attention on every 'lot' in Los Angeles. It is probable that no man in the motion picture business had more friends than the slain director. He had directed virtually every well-known star and thus had come in contact with hundreds of men and women in the various studios in which he had worked. The majority of those who learned the circumstances of Taylor's mysterious death were inclined toward the theory that robbery was the motive. They believe a sneak thief had entered the house during Taylor's temporary absence and that Taylor discovered his presence on his return. The subsequent struggle and shot, they believe, frightened the marauder away without any booty. Comments were heard in many studios on the fact that Taylor had had trouble with Ed. F. Sands, former valet-secretary to the dead man. A felony warrant has been out for Sands for several months and many friends of Mr. Taylor expressed a strong wish to learn Sands' present whereabouts. The theory that there was a 'love motive' in the crime and that its unraveling will reveal a woman either as the instigator, perpetrator or unconscious motive for the shooting was scoffed at by Taylor's friends. From every 'lot' in Los Angeles came the testimony that Taylor had led a life unusually free from feminine entanglements. Charles Eyton, studio manager at Lasky's was emphatic in discrediting the 'Cherchez la Femme' theory of the crime... The same opinion ruled among the press representatives at the Laksy studio where Taylor was well known and warmly admired. Arch Reeve, Barrett Kiesling and Al Wilkie, all of whom had known Taylor for years were convinced that robbery was the motive for the killing. They described him as a man of solitary habits, quiet and reserved, whose name the breath of scandal never had touched... Mary Miles Minter was another star who was greatly shocked by the occurrence. With tears streaming down her face she recalled incidents that happened the last time she had talked with the director...
1922-02-03	Miss Mabel Normand, Mack Sennett film star, who was probably the last friend to see William D. Taylor, the Lasky film director who was shot Wednesday night, alive, told in detail late yesterday afternoon, the time and the incidents of her visit to his home early in the evening, previous to the shooting, and stated that she had no doubt that the person who shot him was the man who had twice robbed him and who had annoyed him with mysterious telephone calls recently. 'There was no affair of the heart whatever between William D. Taylor and myself,' said Miss Normand yesterday afternoon at her beautiful home in West Seventh and Vermont avenue. 'His friendship for me was that of an older man for a girl who liked the outdoor sports he liked and who was eager to glean a little enlightenment from the vast storehouse of knowledge which he possessed. 'Mr. Taylor was a man who knew everything. If I wanted to know the meaning of an unusual word I did not have to take the trouble to hunt up a dictionary. I just had my secretary telephone Mr. Taylor. If I wanted to find the name of a painter or sculptor of some rare work of art he was sure to know that, too, and if I were puzzling over some classical or scientific reference in my reading, I only had to ask him to have the entire matter explained, for besides having the education and the instincts of an artist, he was a deep student of science as well. 'I liked to go out with Mr. Taylor because there was a certain protective dignity in his quiet high bred manner that prevented the obtrusive, offensively familiar person who had only seen my face on the screen, from running up and saying, 'Hello, Mabel!' and we were the best of pals. I think Mr. Taylor had the finest, highest sense of honor of almost any one I have ever known, and I respected him and admired him more than I can tell. My chief liking for him, however, was because of his wonderful brain and the things he could teach me. I am studying French, and as he spoke French fluently he was of great assistance to me and there was hardly a day that he did not recommend some book to me to read. It was to get a book he had phoned about that I went to his house Wednesday evening about 7 o'clock. 'I had been downtown shopping and was at my bank and phoned home to my housekeeper to know if there had been any calls for me. She said Mr. Taylor had phoned that he had the book I wanted, so I attended to a few errands and had my chauffeur drive me by Mr. Taylor's home. I sat down for a few minutes, commented on the change he had made in some bookcases, I had not seen the place in a couple of months. We talked a little of books and plays and he asked me to stay for dinner, saying that although he had had his dinner, he wanted me to try a certain kind of rice pudding his cook had made, but I told him that I had phoned home I would be back to dinner and they were expecting me. 'He then told his colored boy that I would not be staying for dinner and the boy went out just ahead of us. Mr. Taylor took me to my car and on the floor of the car were a number of magazines, some of them, were rather light and I suppose sensational. Mr. Taylor expressed surprise that I read such things and rather upbraided me for having such low-brow taste. He gave me the book, as I got in the car. It was one of Freud's latest, and said I will phone after while and see how you like it. That was the last I ever heard his voice. This morning when Edna Purviance rushed in and said Mr. Taylor was dead I was sure it was all some horrible mistake. 'I came home from Mr. Taylor's house, had my dinner and was in bed before 9 o'clock. I read a little while and when he did not phone I wondered a little and then thought no more about it and went to sleep. 'Mr. Taylor was so uniformly kind to every one. It seems horrible that he should have met a death of this kind, and with the exception of the man who had been in his employ and who had robbed him, I cannot believe he had an enemy in the world. He had a warrant sworn out for the man, but he had never been apprehended. Yesterday Mr. Taylor told his secretary that he had a strange presentment about this man and wished he had not had the warrant sworn-out. 'I wish there were something I could do to throw some light on this terrible tragedy, but it was mere chance that took me to his door a few hours before it happened and I feel very indignant as do also the members of my household and the managers and directors of my company, that my name should have been unnecessarily connected with the unhappy event. Any one, out of scores of his acquaintances might have called at his house on that particular evening and it seemed a cruel thing to me that I should be questioned about it. 'I have known Mr. Taylor for six or seven years. He had high ideals regarding his work and a far reaching vision that made him have great faith in the wonderful things that the moving picture has yet to do. He not only had an eye for beautiful objects and harmony of composition and arrangement, but he had a soul that appreciated the abstract beauty that these things stood for as symbols. To him loyalty, honor, faith, justice and beauty were realities. They were forces that move the world onward and sculpture out recognized qualities in the human countenance. And it was the clean, wholesome beautiful things of life that he wanted to portray on screen. 'Mr. Taylor was a wonderful conversationalist because he observed everything and everybody with the eye of understanding sympathy. He could tell of his travels in Alaska or his trips through Europe and the stories would not be merely geographical descriptions of countries and customs, but philosophical observations that made all of his experiences a commentary on life. 'I feel proud to have called such a man friend and am sorry that his extreme modesty and diffidence kept many from knowing the depth and brilliance of his true nature. But he was not in the least pedantic or high- browish. He was full of wit and jest and he would tease and twit me about things I did or wore, and sometimes we would have a perfect gab fest, in slang, just like a couple of kids. He was just an all around, sure-enough human being. 'I am just in the middle of a big picture and, of course, I am going right on working, but the sudden news of the tragic death of such a friend as this was naturally a great shock to me and I am all broken up today.' Besieged by friends, members of her profession and representatives of the press, Miss Normand denied herself to all callers yesterday and remained in the seclusion of her room, a dainty rose and old ivory boudoir whose walls are lined with books of verse, of plays, of fiction, philosophy, science and history. There were books on the dresser, scattered all over gold-mounted toilet articles, big fat books on art sprawling all over a chaise-lounge, and on a little stand by her bed there were some volumes of poetry and psycho- analytical philosophy. 'Yes, I do read a great deal,' confessed Miss Normand, 'one has to in order to understand what other people are talking about and most of the books you see here were either given me or suggested by Mr. Taylor. I sometimes wondered how he ever got the time to read all the different kinds, of things he had read. 'Mr. Taylor was a man who would have been a credit to any profession on the face of the earth, because he lived a clean, wholesome, upright, life of kindness and usefulness to his fellow beings. Those of us who believe in our art and our profession and have ideals and ambitions for the attainment of success and for that thing which is valued above great riches, a good name, feel that we have not only lost a personal friend but that the profession has lost a rare exemplar whose influence will be missed by all.'
1922-02-03	Tracing the movements of a man suspected of being the slayer of William Desmond Taylor, internationally known film director, who was shot to death in his Alvarado-street apartments Wednesday night, investigators for The Times last night located four witnesses who saw the man before and after the tragedy. Actuated by motives of revenge due to jealousy, the police believe, the murderer fired the fatal shot as near as can be calculated a few minutes before 7:45 p.m., as Mr. Taylor was seated at his writing desk or just as he returned and closed the door when he returned from escorting Mabel Normand, actress, to her car. Between 7:45 and 7:50 p.m., just after the report of the revolver was heard, Mrs. MacLean, wife of Douglas MacLean, the actor, who lives near the Taylor home, saw a man leaving the Taylor apartments. He was described as being about five feet nine or ten inches tall, of medium build and roughly, but not shabbily dressed in dark clothes and a plaid cap. Shortly before 6 o'clock a man answering this description stopped at the Hartley service station, Sixth and Alvarado streets, and inquired where W. D. Taylor resided. Floyd Hartley, 231 South Bonnie Brae street, and L. A. Grant, in charge of the station, were in the place at the time. The circumstances recited by both of these witnesses tally to the minutest detail. The inquirer was 26 or 27 years old, they said, weighed about 165 pounds, wore a dark suit, probably of blue serge, and a light hat or cap. He had dark hair and was of medium complexion. They directed him to the Alvarado Terrace Apartments and he left the oil station. He walked toward the apartments. That was the last they saw of him. Maryland street runs east and west at the rear of Mr. Taylor's apartment. It is a street car stop on the West First-street car line, but passengers board cars there at only rare intervals, possibly not for months. E. W. Dascomb, conductor, and R. S. Woodard, motorman, stated that a man answering the description boarded their car at either 7:54 or 8:27 p.m. They were not certain which stop it was, but took notice because of the infrequency with which passengers are taken on the Maryland-street stop. 'I took particular notice of this passenger on that account,' said Conductor Dascomb. 'It was an inbound trip. This fellow was about five feet and ten inches tall, fairly well dressed, as I remember, weighed about 165 pounds, and his hat or cap was of a light color. I remember that he wore something tan, but I don't recall whether it was his coat or vest. I can't remember where he got off, but I think I would know him again.' Motorman Woodard recalled that Mr. Grant, in charge of the oil station, had mentioned the circumstances of a man inquiring for Mr. Taylor, and of the similarity in descriptions. The descriptions given by Mrs. MacLean, Mr. Woodward, and Mr. Dascomb tally so closely that authorities believe there is little doubt but what that three people saw the same man. It is believed that the slayer had no automobile. Persons residing in the vicinity have taken special notice of machines parked there 'because the noise kept them awake,' and they do not recall having seen any cars parked on Maryland street that night. This lends confirmation to the theory that the killer boarded a West First-street car. Mrs. J. H. Tander and her three sons reside directly across from Mr. Taylor's apartment at 360 South Alvarado Street. The occupants of the house were awake until after 9:30 p.m. and observed no automobile nor saw anyone loitering in the vicinity. Persons residing at 401 Westlake avenue, the house adjacent from Mr. Taylor's apartments, give similar information. Several hours were devoted yesterday to questioning Mabel Normand, well- known motion-picture actress and asserted fiancee of Mr. Taylor. Miss Normand is the last person thus far found who saw him alive. Her chauffeur, William Davis, also was questioned. Their stories were that Miss Normand left the Taylor apartments, 404-B South Alvarado street, at 7:45 p.m. Wednesday. Mr. Taylor accompanied her to the automobile. Immediately after checking up on this phase of the case the police started a search for the man Mrs. MacLean saw leaving the apartments between 7:45 and 7:50 p.m. soon after the report of a pistol shot was heard. While a search was under way for this man, the police also were making energetic efforts to find E. F. Sands, former secretary of Mr. Taylor, who was accused several months ago of forgery by the latter. Since a warrant was issued for the arrest of Sands on the asserted forgeries no trace of his whereabouts has been found. The tremendous resources of the Famous Players-Lasky organization were offered the police yesterday by Jesse L. Lasky, first vice-president of the company, for the capture of the assassin of the film director. Unlimited supply of money, time and effort was promised to the detectives, and every possible assistance will be given them by Mr. Taylor's friends and former associates, the officers were told. News of the murder stirred the motion-picture colony. Several intimate friends rushed to the home, among them being Mary Miles Minter, who became almost hysterical. The revenge and jealousy motive as a theory was strengthened by the fact that none of the valuables in the apartments or in Mr. Taylor's clothing was disturbed. About $78 in money was in his pocketbook, a two-carat diamond ring was not taken, and his platinum watch also was left. Detective Sergeants Herman Cline, Murphy, Cato, Cahill, Zeigler and Wallace, checked many clews. Among one of the leads furnished the police was a report that a man, eager to see Mr. Taylor, had inquired two days before at the Morosco Theater for his residence address, and insisted on getting it at once. The actions of this man aroused suspicion. An autopsy performed at the Ivy Overholtzer undertaking establishment showed that Mr. Taylor had been shot from the back with a .38-caliber revolver. Only one bullet was found. It entered on the left side toward the back about six inches under the arm pit. The course of the bullet indicated it had gone upwards and it was extracted in the fleshy part of the neck on the right side just below the ear. Both lobes of the left lung had been punctured. The nearest approach to an eyewitness account of the crime was furnished by Mrs. MacLean. About 7:45 p.m. she heard the shot and when she looked out the window she saw a man she described as roughly dressed, wearing a plaid cap, open the door of the Taylor apartment. The porch light was turned on, as were the lights in the rest of the house, she stated. This man paused as he came out of the door, looked around as if talking to some one inside and then left. He walked to an alley that leads to Maryland street, passing between Mr. Taylor's house and that of Mrs. MacLean. The murderer, it is believed, lurked in the shadows back to the Taylor flat and in the narrow alley between it and the garage, waiting for his opportunity. This theory of the police was reinforced last night by the discovery of six cigarette stubs in the immediate vicinity of the back door of the Taylor flat and in the alley facing the east windows of the murdered man's apartment. A maid at the MacLean home also said she heard some one lurking in the alley about 7:15 p.m. and heard the fatal shot about thirty minutes later. The man who smoked the cigarettes was very nervous. The half-smoked cigarettes show that. They were scattered around. One was barely touched. Evidently this one was the last one smoked by the man while waiting. It was found in the alley, leading the detectives to believe that the man threw it away almost immediately after lighting it, and that he watched Mr. Taylor leave the house. The back door of the Taylor flat opens on the sidewalk of the south side of Maryland street, just east of Alvarado. Between the east side of the structure where the Taylor flat is located and the garage used by occupants of the flats in the court is a narrow, cement-paved alley. This alley, too, leads into Maryland street. A large tree affords ample protection from the light on Alvarado street at night, blocks the view of the house. It is in the shadow of this tree, the officers believe, that the murderer lay in wait, smoking his cigarettes. More than half a dozen of matches were found on the lawn between the curb of Maryland street and the back window of the Taylor flat. The opportunity for him to enter the house came, the police believe, when Mr. Taylor escorted Miss Normand to her automobile. During the few minutes required for this, the murderer slipped into the open door and waited behind it for the return of Mr. Taylor, the officers think. Mrs. MacLean, who knows Sands, stated the man who left the Taylor apartment did not look familiar to her. The investigators, however, have not relaxed their efforts to find Sands in order to question him in the hope he may be able to aid them in solving the mystery. Mr. Taylor left the Famous Players-Lasky studio, where he was a director, at 4:30 p.m., Wednesday, according to Barrett Keisling, publicity man. From the story related by Henry Peavey, negro, houseman, who found the body, Mr. Taylor came immediately home, ate dinner and was visited by Miss Normand. Los Angeles and New York film colonies were deeply affected by the news of the murder. Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle, awaiting the verdict in his manslaughter trial in San Francisco, said: 'Mr. Taylor's death comes as a great shock to me. We were good friends and never a whisper of scandal arouse about him. He was one of the finest fellows on the 'lot.'' Detective Sergts. Cline, Wynn and Murphy questioned several friends of Mr. Taylor late last night in an effort to obtain any information that may aid in solving the mystery. Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill, both personal friends of Mr. Taylor, left the police station late last night to question a former sweetheart of Mr. Taylor. They declined to divulge her name. Mary Miles Minter, who was directed in several plays by Mr. Taylor and who holds high regard for him, declared yesterday she could think of no enemies or persons who would have a motive in killing him. She denied reports she had ever been engaged to marry him, saying she was extremely sorry she never had been, because she admired him greatly as a man.
1922-02-03	While the police were endeavoring to solve the mystery of who murdered William D. Taylor, motion picture director, his colored houseman, Henry Peavey, who discovered the body yesterday morning, was slated to appear in Police Court to answer a charge of vagrancy. The case, slated for Judge Chamber's court, was called, but on account of Peavey's absence was put over, the date to be set later. Peavey's arrest followed asserted acts of indecency several days ago in Westlake Park.
1922-02-03	Among the mute evidences of what had taken place in the home of William D. Taylor Wednesday night, when he was shot, was an expensive silver and cut- glass drinking service. On it were a decanter, a shaker used in mixing drinks, and two large glasses with portions of a drink left in them. Cigarette stubs littered the tray. In the glasses was orange pulp, apparently left from an orange and gin concoction. This service was found on the dining-room table. The body was in an adjoining room.
1922-02-03	Mabel Normand, seen at her home at Seventh street and Vermont avenue yesterday, was much agitated over the murder of her old friend, William D. Taylor. She gave a clear and frank statement of all her movements Wednesday afternoon and evening. J. A. Waldron, the Mack Sennett studio manager, was with her all day, answering phone calls and receiving messages, Miss Normand stated. Continuing, she stated that she spent the afternoon downtown, attending principally to income tax matters and to her banking. She then called her home from the bank at Sixth and Main streets and asked if there were any messages for her. Her maid said: 'Mr. Taylor has been trying to get you all the afternoon, and we told him that you were out. We told him you were downtown.' 'He had been trying to get some books for me that I wanted,' said Miss Normand. 'We always discussed books a great deal. He told the maid he had got one of the books at Parker's and was sending it by his chauffeur. He said that he had obtained the other book I wanted at Robinson's, and left word with the maid for me to stop at his house and get it. 'I went and bought 5 cents worth of peanuts, but the man didn't have any change; so I went to the drug store in the Pacific Electric Building and got the change. I bought a lot of magazines and papers, among others a Police Gazette. I ate the peanuts on the way, and we drove out to Mr. Taylor's, and when I got out I told my chauffeur to clean the car. Then I went up on the steps. I heard Mr. Taylor talking to somebody over the phone, underneath the stairs, and I hesitated about going in until he had finished. Then I entered. He had been talking to Mrs. Marjorie Berger, who has charge of the income tax business for many of the picture folk, including myself. 'He came in and said, 'Gee, I am glad to see you.' I said, 'I just came up for the book.' 'I arrived at his house about five minutes after 7. We talked about books. I looked around his drawing-room, and told him I thought he had changed his house furnishings. He said, 'You haven't been here for so long you forgot.' I hadn't been to his house before in two months. He said, 'The Victrola is the only thing new.' 'His servant, Henry, had been arrested for some sort of misconduct, and he was saying that perhaps he would have to go down to court tomorrow (that's today) to see about it. Henry came in, and I said to Mr. Taylor, 'Have you had your dinner?' He said, 'Yes, have you had yours?' I said, 'No, but I am tired, and I'm going home now. I have a studio call for 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.' I've been going to bed very early every night--haven't been anywhere since I began work on my present picture. 'We were talking about the cameraman's ball next Saturday night, and he said he had a box, and I said I had one. He told me whom he was going to take and wanted to know whom I was going to take. 'Henry went out and talked to my chauffeur as my chauffeur cleaned up the car. Henry was telling my chauffeur what a nice man Taylor was to work for. 'Finally Mr. Taylor said 'Well, if you're tired why don't you go home and rest and I will call you up this evening.' I asked Mr. Taylor who lived in the different bungalows in the court, and he told me. We stood outside two or three minutes talking. He had left his door open. He put me in the car, and as he saw the peanut shells, and the pile of books, he laughed and said: 'Here you are with Nietzsche under one arm and Freud under the other and the Police Gazette close by. You certainly are going in for heavy reading this winter.' I said, 'Yes, I wish I could get hold of Joe Miller's Joke Book: that would complete the set.' Then he said 'Good-night, I will call you up in about an hour.' 'I went home, had my dinner at once and was in bed and asleep by 8 o'clock. I didn't have to go to the studio this morning because there was something the matter with the set. 'Edna Purviance called me up this morning and said 'Have you heard the terrible news? William D. Taylor's valet is running up and down the court screaming he is dead. They say he died of heart failure.' Afterward I learned that he had been murdered. 'I hear that Mr. Taylor told Mrs. Berger he wished that he had called off the warrant he had against Sands. I understand that he felt apprehensive of harm from him. There were, I hear, all sorts of mysterious telephone calls and all that. Sands was one of those servile human beings, apparently all devotion to Mr. Taylor.' Miss Normand says that Edward Knoblock had Mr. Taylor's house while Mr. Taylor was in Europe last summer and that Mr. Taylor had Mr. Knoblock's London house. Sands apparently stayed right along in Mr. Taylor's service in Los Angeles, and also assisted Mr. Knoblock. Two or three days before Mr. Taylor was to arrive from London, Sands told Mr. Knoblock that he thought he would take two or three days leave of absence, but would be back soon. He never showed up again. When Mr. Taylor arrived from London, he said he found that Sands had stolen everything, had forged his name to checks and had gone to Hamburger's and bought lingerie. He had a sweetheart here. Miss Normand doesn't know who she was. A few weeks ago Mr. Taylor's house was robbed again. Then from Stockton he kept getting anonymous letters, and he received a pawnbroker's ticket, showing that things had been pawned in the name of a Mrs. Tennant [sic], who is Mr. Taylor's sister-in-law. The way Mr. Taylor knew it was really Sands was because he had always spelled Mrs. Tennent's name wrong, and the wrong spelling was on the ticket. 'Mr. Taylor knew that Sands wasn't out of California by this fact,' said Miss Normand. Mrs. Marjorie Burger [sic] said that Mr. Taylor had told her often that he had been getting mysterious phone calls. He talked so funny, saying that he had wished sometimes that he had dropped prosecution. Mrs. Burger said: 'Why don't you get somebody to watch?' But he said, 'Oh, no.' As for Mabel Normand's reported engagement to Mr. Taylor: she said, 'We have always been great friends. We love to talk over books and that sort of thing. He's the sort of man who can come to the house, sit and read while I play the piano, and talk informally over our work and over our books.' Mabel Normand admitted that Mr. Taylor had asked her to marry him, but that phase of the friendship had been over for some time. They were just good pals, she said. Miss Normand and Mr. Taylor were seen out together a great deal at one time; but of late they have hardly seen each other at all, she said.
1922-02-03	The first theory of the murder of William D. Taylor, motion-picture director, evolved by the detectives assigned to the case, was as follows: Mr. Taylor, just finishing his dinner, was visited by Mabel Normand. They discussed a scenario and several other matters relating to motion pictures. Some time shortly after 7 p.m. Henry Peavey, negro houseman employed by Taylor, left the apartments for the night, leaving Mr. Taylor and Miss Normand. About 7:45 p.m., Miss Normand left the apartment, according to her statement. She was accompanied to her automobile at the curbing by Mr. Taylor. Her negro [sic] chauffeur was waiting for her and drove her home, which she reached about 8 o'clock. It was during this absence from the house by Mr. Taylor that his slayer entered the apartment through the door that had been left open, the theory goes. When Mr. Taylor entered the door on his return he was immediately attacked, being shot from the back, probably as he closed the door. The assailant left immediately. The shot was heard about 7:45 p.m., according to the account given by Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of Douglas MacLean, motion-picture actor. Her maid also heard the report. Mrs. MacLean went to the door of her apartment and saw a man leaving by the front door of Mr. Taylor's home. He closed the door and looked around back of him. Then he walked between the Taylor house and the one adjacent on the west [sic], going north by the side entrance to Maryland street. The description of this man was given to the officer
1922-02-03	Henry Peavey had been employed about six months by Mr. Taylor as houseman and valet. He never slept in the house, leaving after the dinner, if his master ate at home and returning the next morning. 'I had turned back the covers on Mr. Taylor's bed, put some ice water on the table and finished the supper things,' Peavey related. 'The income tax lady called on the telephone, and then Miss Normand arrived in her automobile. They sat in rocking chairs and talked about some book. Mr. Taylor was always reading books. He sometimes told me he had read until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. Once when he was making a picture he showed me a pile of books, and said, 'I've got to read all these.' 'Well, I motioned to Mr. Taylor and he said, 'You may go now, Henry.' That was about 7:30 o'clock. On the way to work in the morning I stopped at a drug store and got a bottle of milk of magnesia. I often got that for Mr. Taylor. I'd just buy it with my own money and every once in a while tell him how much I had spent. He was a good man. He never asked me what I had spent money for; just how much I had spent to keep him comfortable. As soon as I opened the door I saw his feet. I said, 'Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor.' Then I peeped in and saw his face, and I knew something had happened. I started to yell and all the people in the court came out. I ran to the landlord. No, sir, I didn't go into the house. No, sir. 'Mr. Taylor had few friends call. I can only remember his having people for dinner two or three times since I have been with him. At night he would stay home and read. He went out little and drank very little. He was a very good man.'
1922-02-03	The discovery of the murder of William Desmond Taylor was made about 7:30 a.m. yesterday when Henry Peavey, colored house man employed by Taylor, came to work. Peavey says he opened the front door and was first attracted by the body lying on the floor of the living-room, when he saw Mr. Taylor's feet. The body was feet toward the door and over the legs was a chair that apparently had been overturned. Peavey declares he called to his employer and then decided he was dead. 'I ran from the house, ' Peavey said, 'and the folks around here say I made a commotion. The neighbors came running and later they took the body away.' Peavey last saw Mr. Taylor alive Wednesday night about 7:30 o'clock, he said. He had prepared dinner for him and just as he was serving dessert, Mabel Normand, well-known film actress and said by friends to have been his fiancee, came to see Mr. Taylor. This visit began about 7 o'clock, Peavey stated. When he left the home at 7:30 p.m., Miss Normand was still there. A physician was called and at first it was believed the death was of natural causes, probably brought about by a hemorrhage. It was not until a considerable time after the remains were taken to the Ivy Overholtzer undertaking establishment that discovery was made that Mr. Taylor had been shot. The wound was in the back, entering at the left side in a line under the heart. A steel jacketed bullet apparently had been used and the wound had practically closed up thus making detection at first difficult. Peavey said he had been in the employ of Mr. Taylor for about six months. Mr. Taylor had lived in the apartments at the Alvarado courts about two years. The scene left in the magnificently appointed apartment occupied by Mr. Taylor showed little signs of a struggle. The overturned chair was the only indication of a struggle or of the haste of the assailant to escape. The door, which has a night latch, was locked from the outside, but the latch was set so that no key was necessary to accomplish this. A writing desk was situated near the door, against the front wall of the room. On this desk were many papers indicating that Mr. Taylor had been preparing his income tax return for this year and adjusting other business. Some scenarios also were scattered about. On top of the desk was a picture of Mabel Normand. In a place of honor on the top of the upright piano was a photograph of Miss Normand. Three, in all, were conspicuously displayed. Photographs of many persons known throughout the world as film stars also were displayed in the rooms of the apartment. About the border of the living room and dining-room Mr. Taylor had placed a solid border of autographed and framed photographs. Among them were pictures of Mary Pickford, whom he had directed in three pictures before enlisting in the World War. On this picture was written, 'To my nice director, William Taylor, the most patient man that I know, with sincere friendship, Mary Pickford.' In a prominent place was Mary Miles Minter's photograph. This bore the following expression of admiration: 'For William Desmond Taylor, Artist, gentleman, man! Sincere good wishes, Mary Miles Minter, 1920.' Soon after the news of the murder had spread, Mary Miles Minter and her mother rushed to the house to see if they could be of any aid. Miss Minter declared that Mabel Normand had been engaged for about six months to Mr. Taylor. The grief of Miss Minter was shown by the tears which she shed while viewing the scene where her friend had been shot. Later in the morning Frank O'Connor, formerly an assistant director under Mr. Taylor and for many years a close friend, visited the apartments. He sounded high praise for Mr. Taylor. Charles Eyton, general manager of the Lasky studio, was present when the undertaker removed the valuables from the person of Mr. Taylor. L. P. Waterman, deputy public administrator, was called and assumed charge of the property. Detective Sergeants Zeigler and Wallis, assigned to the case when the first report of the death was made to the police, interviewed Miss Normand and obtained a statement from her, they reported, that she had left the apartment some time around 8 o'clock. She was not sure of the time, but placed it at approximately 7:45 p.m. In the court where Mr. Taylor lived there are sixteen apartments. It is composed of eight two-story white stucco buildings. E. C. Jessurun, proprietor of the court, responded to the alarm raised by the negro houseman.
1922-02-03	In the numerous romances of William Desmond Taylor with the beautiful women in Hollywood's movie colony, the police are seeking a clew to lead them to his assassin. Names famous in movieland are being linked with the story of the tragedy. The mystery of the slaying and the stories of gallantries in which Taylor is the hero, overshadow any of those pictured in the film studios where he was one of the moving spirits. Three women movie stars are known to have visited his luxurious bungalow at 404B South Alvarado street, where his body was found this morning, within a few hours of the time he must have died. The slayer now is believed to have been hiding near the bungalow while Mabel Normand was with Taylor, a period of perhaps two hours. When Taylor left the house to escort Miss Normand, the slayer is believed to have slipped into the house, to lurk there until the chance came to end the life of the man he hated. Another actress of national repute went to the house about two hours later, the detectives have been told. What was the purpose or the result of her visit has not been disclosed as yet. At the time of her visit, according to the opinion of physicians, Taylor had been dead for nearly two hours. The police seek an answer to the double-barreled question: 'What did this beautiful actress go to see, and what did she see?' An hour later Edna Purviance, a next door neighbor and long time friend of Taylor, reached her home. She saw a light in Taylor's study and rang his bell. There was no answer. She told the police she decided he was out or did not wish visitors, so she went to her own home. With these facts for a background and stories of Taylor's love affairs, gleaned in the studios, the police have subordinated but not abandoned the possibility that the hand of a woman scorned by Taylor fired the shot. They are concentrating on tracking down the shadowy unknown who lurked around the bungalow and, as they believe, dodged in, killed Taylor and escaped. One witness says she saw a man dressed in dark clothing and wearing a checkered cap, standing at the partly opened door of Taylor's bungalow and peering in. The housemaid of another neighbor saw a man running through an alley back of the house shortly after the report of a revolver was heard. This noise was ascribed at the time to an automobile blowout, but detectives are not satisfied it was the shot that ended Taylor's life. The unidentified man is described as roughly dressed. This may be a ruse to throw the police off the track of the slayer. Where men and women make their fortunes by impersonation, in the studios it is not improbable that they might resort to the expedient of a disguise to carry out a plan of vengeance. Whether the slayer, if it was a man who killed Taylor, acted in jealous rage because of attentions to a woman with whom he was infatuated, or did the bidding of a furious woman who later crept to the bungalow and peered, white- faced, upon the scene of the tragedy before slipping away again, are elements of the problem that face the investigators. These are all details they hope to bring to light in following through the maze through which Taylor passed in his endless search for beauty and which led him finally to his death. He was 50 years old. Beauty was the dominating impulse of his career. He sought for the beautiful in his pictures. It was this which brought him fame as the chief director of the Famous Players-Lasky corporation. It was his selection that brought the most beautiful of actresses into the pictures he directed. ...Taylor was a high liver and had many women friends. He was, according to general opinion in the motion picture colony, engaged for a time to Mary Miles Minter and later to Mabel Normand. A Mrs. Paul A. Crawford Ivers, continuity editor for Lasky's, is also reported to have been a friend of his. Taylor had been married twice, having been divorced both times. He was pre-eminently a man who kept the greater part of his life a mystery to those about him. Few men knew very much about his business interests which in a purely investment way and aside from his large earnings as chief motion picture director for the largest producing concern in the world, were extensive. Similarly he was a man of decided attraction for woman, but one who, in affairs of the heart as in everything else, played without making any noise...
1922-02-03	Because of the variance in the descriptions of the man Mrs. MacLean saw and Sands, the police are inclined to drop any suspicion of this former valet, and they likewise place little credence in the robbery theory, as no material facts seem to support such a possibility. But some woman, they believe, is at the apex of the triangle, the other two points of which are a man with a revolver and William Desmond Taylor, noted Lasky director (deceased)...
1922-02-03	Detectives admitted late today that they had under surveillance a prominent young man who might possibly be linked with the murder of William Desmond Taylor, prominent motion picture director, who was found shot to death in his luxurious apartments at 404-B South Alvarado street. The detectives have been watching this mysterious man all day. They would not divulge his name, but said that they were confident that he may have had something to do with the shooting of Taylor. If he tries to leave town, it is said, he will be taken into custody. An expert gunsmith, whose name was not divulged, has offered his services to Captain of Detectives David Adams. He is to take the bullet which was extracted from Taylor's body and by examination tell what kind of gun was used. The inquest will be held at 10 a.m. tomorrow, it was announced late today. The inquest was originally scheduled to be held at 1:30 p.m. Two witnesses, who were questioned today, and said to be very prominent in the motion picture world, declared they saw two men, one of whom answered the description of Edward Sands, loitering about the Taylor home some time before the shooting. The time of the shooting has been placed at between 7:45 p.m. and 8:15. Taylor's chauffeur told the detectives that he tried to call his employer at 8:15 on the night of the murder, and was unable to get him. He said he assumed that the director had stepped out. Detectives today were known to be quietly seeking a young New York broker, whose identity is being kept secret, to question him in an effort to bring to light more facts about the murder. This young man is said to have been prominent in movie society. He is described as a friend of a prominent movie actress. He came from the east, according to the story which detectives are investigating, shortly after the actress returned from a trip to New York, which she made some months ago. Detectives gave no intimation of what light they believed he might possibly shed on the mysterious slaying... Police detectives are concentrating today on the theory that Taylor probably was murdered by a 'love killer'--a man who resented Taylor's attention to some woman... A guest in the Dumas home next to Taylor said he saw two men last Monday night in the court yard. The men, the guest said, went to the door of Taylor's home, tried the door with a key, then walked away. One of these men, the police believe, is probably the murderer. Taylor's colored valet, Harry [sic] Peavey, who found the body, said that on several occasions Taylor had been annoyed by mysterious persons walking around his house. He said that on one occasion he asked Taylor why he didn't carry his gun. 'Somebody is liable to walk up those stairs when you're in your bedroom,' he said he told Taylor, 'and hold you up.' 'No, he won't,' Peavey said Taylor replied. 'I keep my gun on the bureau, and if I hear anyone walking up those stairs and he doesn't answer when I call him, he's a goner.' Peavey said Taylor did drive away these nocturnal visitors on several occasions at the point of a gun.... The newest clues, vague, but showing possibilities of untangling the mystery point to two or more unrequited loves for the murdered man. These women, beautiful, young and prominent, are said to have displayed affections for Taylor, who it is reported did not reciprocate. Tips over the telephone and by letter have come to the police station regarding the mystery slaying. So many angles of this case have developed that it is difficult to find any tangible clue that would lead to the discovery of the assassin....
1922-02-03	If I had been engaged to marry Mr. Taylor, I would be only too proud to acknowledge it.' In such manner did Miss Mabel Normand, movie star, reiterate to me her denial of any engagement with William D. Taylor, the director, who was murdered Wednesday evening. Tears were in Miss Normand's eyes, her lithe body quivered and shook. She was under a terrible nervous strain. Her voice quavered and broke while she spoke of the dead man. 'I had known Mr. Taylor for years,' she continued, 'ever since I've lived at the Buckingham, but there never was any love affair existing between us--ever!' 'I loved Mr. Taylor as a good comrade--a pal with whom I could discuss subjects in which we were both mutually interested. For instance, I had been studying French and Mr. Taylor, who spoke French fluently, helped me tremendously. And, too, I have been somewhat interested in philosophy and metaphysics, and in those subjects he was again an invaluable teacher. 'I seldom saw Mr. Taylor, it's true, except at a gathering of friends. But frequently I conversed with him over the telephone. As a general rule merely to ask certain questions regarding the subjects I just mentioned. 'Wednesday evening was the first time I ever called upon Mr. Taylor alone. Then I stopped in for a few minutes on my way home in response to a message from Mr. Taylor left with my secretary. The message stated that Mr. Taylor already had sent one book I wanted to the house and had purchased another--one I wanted particularly--and had it at his place. It was for that book that I stopped by. 'I arrived about 7 o'clock and left at 7:45. He accompanied me to my car and talked to me a few minutes, laughingly criticizing my literary taste; there was a copy of the Police Gazette in the car and he thought it didn't very well fit in with Freud and Nietsche. 'After saying good night and promising to phone me within an hour, I directed William, my chauffeur, to drive me home. Being tired and having a studio call at 7:30 next morning, I retired to my room and within a few minutes I was in bed, where I had dinner served to me. That was about 8:15. Then I dropped off to sleep and slept until Edna Purviance phoned me the following morning the news of Mr. Taylor's death. 'Did I know that Mr. Taylor had been married? No. I don't know now that he was. People had told me, but I don't know if it was true. Mr. Taylor never discussed with me his private affairs; there was no reason for his doing so. 'I am so terribly shocked over this horrible tragedy I don't know what to do or say. It doesn't seem possible that anyone so lovable--a man who had so many friends and not a known enemy could have been so brutally killed. 'My one wish is that the murderer be apprehended and that punishment, however horrible, be meeted out to him.'
1922-02-03	No, I never was engaged to marry William Desmond Taylor, I regret to say. 'No, I was not at his home on the night he was murdered. I was at my home reading a book. 'I had seen very little of him since we returned from Europe a year ago. 'He didn't have an enemy in the world. 'I am positive he was never married, because he would have told me so if he was. 'I love little Mabel Normand and I want the whole world to know that I love her, and appreciate her sterling qualities.' These were the outstanding statements regarding the mysterious murder of her former director, William Desmond Taylor, made by pretty Mary Miles Minter in an interview at her home last night. Curled up before the fireplace of her quaint adobe home with its soft lights and Spanish furnishings, the lovely blonde star was the center of an interested group of newspaper folk, who wished to employ her aid in solving the murder of the man so brutally slain. Miss Minter has a cold. She was exposed to a cold water bath in the filming of a picture last week, and is recuperating from her experience. But in an attractive dark frock that set off her blonde beauty and with golden hair, she was a pretty picture sitting before the crackling flames. Never in her varied but successful career has the screen star figured in a more interesting story than the one in which her former director lost his life. Miss Minter wants to help clear up the mystery and do all in her power to bring the slayer to justice. 'I could use every praiseworthy adjective in the English language to describe him,' she said, 'and still could not explain to you what a wonderful man he was. 'I had never met a man like him. He was loved by everyone who knew him. You just couldn't help trusting him. 'And everyone who ever had business dealings with him appreciated his kindness, consideration for others, his generosity. 'Just think,' the star broke down, 'here I was home, reading a book-- enjoying it so much--and he was lying there in his apartment, stone dead. 'Oh, I cannot believe that he has been murdered! 'Why, I went to his house this morning--mamma and I (pointing to her charming grandmother, Mrs. Mary Miles)--I always call grandma 'mamma' and mother 'mother'--and I couldn't believe he was dead! 'I loved him--of course not as--well, you know--but I loved him devotedly. He looked upon me more or less as a child, don't you know. And, although I saw a great deal of him before I went to Europe, after we got back we couldn't drag him away from his work, could we, mother?' the star asked her youthful parent, Mrs. Selby [sic], who smiled indulgently upon her pretty daughter. 'No,' said Mrs. Selby, 'he was more a hard worker. Really, he was more interested in his business than anything else. 'Do you know where his ex-wife and daughter are?' Miss Minter was asked. Miss Minter's violet colored eyes flashed fire. 'Why he had no wife--he was never married. I'm positive of that!' she replied. 'But, maybe Mary, he didn't tell you he was married,' broke in Mother. 'But mother, I knew him so well--I am sure he wasn't married. I asked him if he was, and he told me no. 'I don't think he was interested in women particularly,' said the star. 'I never was engaged to marry him--no, it wouldn't be fair to say that I was. Of course,' she laughed, 'every once in a while someone has me engaged to someone--they've had me engaged to eight men this year. 'You see he was nearly 50 years old--and although if I loved him and he was 75 I would marry him--but oh, no, there was nothing to that.' 'Had you heard of a romance between Mabel Normand and Mr. Taylor?' Miss Minter was asked. 'No, I hadn't,' she said, 'but I don't think there was anything to that. If it is true that he had asked to marry her, well I am glad that he and Mabel were such good friends. Mabel is a lovely girl. She is frank--if she wants to do anything she does it--that's why I admire Mabel. 'And she is big-hearted and noble of character. I love Mabel Normand.' 'When did you see Mr. Taylor last?' the actress was asked. 'Let's see,' she pondered. 'I hadn't seen dear old Mr. Taylor since before Christmas. In fact, I hadn't seen him in a year. Oh, yes, we passed him on the boulevard yesterday --just think, it was a few hours before he was murdered.' Miss Minter was almost in tears. 'Have they found his former valet?' she asked suddenly. She intimated that she believed Edward F. Sands was the villain, but she said: 'It would be unfair to accuse anyone of the crime. Maybe a crank or some demented person committed it. Did you see 'The Bat' at the Mason? There is a mystery story that would thrill you. You would sit on the edge of the seat while it is showing. I saw it in New York.'
1922-02-03	Another tip in connection with the Taylor murder mystery 'blew up' at noon today. It was the clue that Edward Sands, former secretary and valet for the murdered man, was being held at the city jail. Upon investigation it was found that a Sands was in jail, but that his name is Edward W. Sands. He was arrested for petty larceny at a downtown department store and sentenced to serve 30 days in the city jail. Sands was given probation several years ago by Judge Craig after his conviction on a charge of grand larceny in connection with the alleged theft of automobile tires. He is now held at the county jail pending a hearing in Judge Reeve's court for violation of parole.
1922-02-03	Henry Peavey, 40, of 127 1/2 East Third street, who found the body of William D. Taylor, famous motion picture director, found murdered in his home at 404B South Alvarado street, was scheduled to go to police court yesterday afternoon to face a charge of social vagrancy. Peavey, according to Patrolman S. G. White, was arrested, charged with being lewd and dissolute in Westlake park a few hours before his employer was murdered. Taylor, it is said, bailed the negro out. His case was taken off the calendar after Taylor's death. No date was set for the trial.
1922-02-03	The seven detectives who are most actively engaged in hunting the murderer told the International News Service it is one of the most baffling cases in the annals of the local police department. It was stated that a complete probe will be made of Taylor's past life in an effort to get behind the veil of mystery surrounding the case and bring the slayer to justice. 'Wherever the trail leads, there will be detectives to follow,' said one police official. 'There will be no whitewashing of any person or any group of persons.' One of the foremost moving picture actresses was scheduled to be questioned late today regarding her asserted love for Taylor. While no suspicion rests on the woman, the police say, she may be able to throw a direct ray of light on some asserted love tangle in which Taylor may have been a principal. Among the various phases of the investigation was a report that Taylor had attended several so-called 'snow' parties, at which narcotics were served from tea wagons, for the purpose of obtaining local color for some of his pictures. The slaying, one detective pointed out, may have been an aftermath of such a party. Weird narratives of a mystic love cult also entered into the investigation when reports to the police linked Taylor's name with the strange life of the cult leaders. The weird love which was said to have existed as a part of the cult may have inspired one of the members to have caused Taylor's death, according to another detective who spent considerable time in delving into the mysticisms and entanglements of the asserted coterie... One of Taylor's closest friends, and a former business associate, told the International News Service this afternoon that he has arrived at the conclusion the director was killed at the instigation of a woman. 'I have been in touch with the police for 24 hours,' said this man, 'and I know the theories on which they have been working. They have now arrived at the belief he was murdered in a vengeance plot. 'I know Taylor was very friendly with one woman screen star. He gave her a farewell party last summer before he went to Europe. He took her to the Writers' Cramp, a notable entertainment recently given for the celebrities of 'movie' colony. 'The director and I had many conversations of a personal nature. But he was more or less of a man of mystery. I do not know that he had been friendly in recent months with any woman other than the screen actress, but it seems likely to me that a man of his engaging personality and magnetic charm should have attracted a number of women. 'Since I am positive that he had no business enemies, I am inclined to believe a woman's hand was at the bottom of it all and that the man who fired the shot was paid to do it.'
1922-02-03	Police said today that the arrest of a mystery man seen loitering in the vicinity of the Taylor residence about the time of the murder was believed near. This man, seen by many persons, was suspected of having killed Taylor because of jealousy. It was believed that the man under suspicion was intimate with some woman friend of the slain director...
1922-02-03	The names of two young film actresses and a man who has so far not figured in the case were linked by the police today in their investigation into the slaying of William Desmond Taylor, noted film director. The names of these persons are for the time being withheld by the police. The man, however, is known to have had a bitter quarrel with Taylor within the last month. He is under surveillance. Another man, who has already been questioned by the police, is also being watched and may again be quizzed before dawn tomorrow. The police are convinced that he has not told all he may know of circumstances surrounding the case. These facts are the outstanding ones today in the now famous murder mystery, known in police circles as the Taylor murder. It is calling forth the best efforts of seven detective sergeants, and many plainclothes officers. Subpenas for more than a half score of film stars and men prominent in the motion picture industry were served by police detectives today for the inquest at 1:30 o'clock tomorrow afternoon over the body of Taylor. Among those who will testify will be Mary Miles Minter, Douglas MacLean, Mabel Normand, Edna Purviance, Charles Eyton, Mrs. Douglas MacLean and Mrs. Julia Crawford Ivers. The inquest will be conducted by Coroner Nance and his chief assistant, William McDonald, in the mortuary of the Ivy H. Overholtzer undertaking establishment. Directly after Detective Sergeants Ziegler and Walls had left with the subpenas, Detective Sergeants Wood, Murphy, Herman Cline, Winn, Cato and Cahill left for separate places to run down clues that had been sent to Detective Capt. Dave Adams within the last 12 hours. These officers were to meet late today to report to Captain Adams the results of their quests. In the meantime it is known that two of the officers were questioning closely Taylor's chauffeur, in an effort to learn the places he had taken the film director during the last few weeks that might reveal some clew as to the identity of possible enemies... One important fact was brought out by Detective Sergeant Herman Cline, opening up theories of possible robbery as motive. It was known to several friends that on Wednesday Taylor had in his possession in gold and currency $2300. He had intended putting this money in the bank the following day, but for some unknown reason he visited the bank late Wednesday and deposited the money. It is the belief of Sergeant Cline that if robbery was the motive the burglar after firing the shot became frightened that the noise might have aroused some persons in the neighborhood, and fled without attempting to steal anything... Several things have been discovered in Taylor's past, the officers say, that may assist in solving the mystery. The police today were close on the trail of a man who three hours before the murder made inquiries in the neighborhood as to the location of Taylor's home... Taylor was a man who possessed great nerve and coolness under any circumstances. Friends say he probably would have refused to obey the order of a burglar to hold up his hands. Such being the case, it is possible according to the robbery theory that the burglar fired the one shot that ended the man's life... An investigation was also put under way to determine whether or not the mysterious telephone calls frequently received by Taylor might lead to the identity of the murderer. The director, his friends say, often told of the calls in the night. When he answered there was no answer, it is said. This phase of the situation, however, the police believe, indicates that some one laid careful plans for the murder of the director and had long borne a grudge against him...
1922-02-03	Miss Edna Purviance, who lived in the two-story bungalow adjoining the home of William D. Taylor, the Lasky film director who was shot Wednesday night, said that when she returned to her home some time near midnight Wednesday she noticed lights burning in Mr. Taylor's house, but that as Mr. Taylor was given to burning the midnight oil, being a great reader, she thought nothing of it. 'I was awakened,' said Miss Purviance last night, 'early Thursday morning by the terrifying voice of some one who seemed to be running up and down the court, screaming, 'Mr. Taylor is dead! Mr. Taylor is dead!' I looked out the window and saw his Negro boy Henry, who was almost frantic with grief, as he was very much attached to Mr. Taylor. 'Before they found the bullet wound in Mr. Taylor's back they thought he had died of heart disease, and that seemed terrible enough, but when we learned he had been murdered, almost at our own door, it seemed too horrible to believe. 'I knew Mr. Taylor only very slightly. I had never worked with him and had only met him to a purely formal social way. I thought him to be a very interesting, likable, discerning gentleman, with gallant, polished manners and a brilliant intellect. 'I always heard him spoken of as a man with a reputation above reproach and a nature that was kind and generous. Although living as a near neighbor,I saw him very infrequently and knew nothing of his private life or of his love affairs, if he had any. I knew that he and Miss Normand were good friends but knew nothing of heart interest on either side.'
1922-02-03	Film Director Is Slain at Desk; Murderer Stands Behind Chair  W. D. Taylor Found Mysteriously Murdered in Los Angeles Was Scanning Canceled Checks When Shot Mabel Normand, Last Visitor, Says He Feared Former Servant. Thrice "Friendly Burglar's" Victim.   Los Angeles. Feb. 2 (By the Associated Press). Mystery tonight surrounded the murder of William Desmond Taylor, internationally known  motion picture director, who was found dead at his desk in his home here this morning. The bullet which ended his life had been fired into his neck from behind and had ranged downward, piercing his heart. On the desk beside his head lay a mass of canceled checks which he apparently had been inspecting when the fatal shot was fired. Robbery, according to the police,  could not have been the motive, for nothing was missing from the apartment although a considerable sum of money and jewelry was found undisturbed near the body.    Told Actress of Fear. One of the last persons to see Tayfor, who was director in chief at the Famous Players-Lasky studios, alive was Mabel Normand, fil comedienne. She called upon him early yesterday evening. She told detectives today that she stopped at the apartment to return a book Taylor had loaned her and talked with him for about half an hour. She said Taylor expressed fear of a former servant who, he alleged, robbed him. She also said Taylor had told her he might call at her home several blocks away, later in the evening and that he might telephone." Miss Normand left the apartment about 9 oclock, she said, this statement being corroborated by her chauffeur. Both said Tayior walked to the car with her. She said she had not seen or heard from him again. Taylor 's only servant, who left the apartments at the same time as the actress last night, found the body on returning this morning. The servant said both front and dear doors of the apartment were looked when he arrived. The front door opens upon a court, even with the street level, from which anyone could have entered the apartment if      it were unlocked. with little chance of being observed. The door has a spring lock.   Seeking Former Servant. Most of the early efforts of the investigators today were directed to an attempt to locate the former servant of Taylor 's, against whom the motion picture man had lodged a complaint  with the police some time ago. Tayfor declared the man had stolen some I of his belongings and forged his name to a check. and that he believed a burglary of his apartment some time alter was committed by the same person. The wife of a motion picture actor living in the same group of apartments said that she saw a man standing at the door of Taylor 's place about 8 oclock last night. She said is he appeared to have the door partly open and to be looking in. She described the man as short and stockily built and wearing a checkered cap. This description does not tally with  that of the former servant.   Left Miss Normand There. Harry Peavey. Taylors negro servant, told the police that he left the apartment, according to his custom, at about 7:30 o'clock last night. He  said that Miss Normand was still there at that time, having arrived while he was serving dinner about half an hour earlier. The police made it plain that they had no suspicion as far as Miss Normand was concerned, but questioned her merely in looking I for possible clews in all available quarters. When Taylor 's body was first found, it was thought that he had died from a hemorrage, so slight was the wound in his neck left by the passage of the is bullet. After this wound was discovered. search was begun for the pistol which fired the shot. but it could not be found. Nothing in the apartment was disturbed, the slayer, apparently, having fined without leaveing a single clew behind. Miss Normand was said by the police to have received her first word of the tragedy through Edaa Purviance. also a motion picture actress, whose apartment is near that occupied by Taylor. Miss Purviance called Miss Normand on the telephone as soon as she heard the details of the shooting. The police were said to be considering the possibility that Taylor was shot by the discarded suitor of some, woman with whom he had been friendly; by a former servant he had, caused to be arrested for an alleged crime and who was said to have threatened his life; by a burglar who  was surprised when Taylor returned is from escorting Miss Normand to her care, or possibly by a woman who, for it some unknown reason, had become enraged at him. Miss Normand stated tonight there "had been no affair of the heart whatever" between her and Taylor. "His friendship for me was that of an older man for a girl who liked the outdoor sports he liked, and who was eager to glean a little enlightenment from the vast storehouse of knowledge he possessed." For several months it had been rumored, but never confirmed, that Miss Normand was engaged to marry Taylor. The detectives expressed the belief is the director was slain by a man, basing their theory on statements made by Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of a film actor, and her maid, that they had seen a stranger about the Taylor apartments both before and after is neighbors heard a shot.   Taylors career Adventurous. Taylor had an adventurous career. which included three trips to Alaska. during one of which he wrested was a small fortune from the Klondike, He  served during the world war with they British army having been born in Ireland, and within a few months rose from the ranks of a private to a captain. He was trained for the engineering profession, but turned to the stage when 18 years old. He left the stage to join the first rush to Alaska. Taylor had been director -in-chief of I the Famous Players-Lasky plant in Hollywood.   Tells of "Friendly" Robber New York. Feb. 2. William Desmond Taylor, motion picture director for the Famous Payers-Lasky Corporation, whose body, with a bullet through the heart, was found in his home in Loss Angeles today. twice in eight months had been the victim of a "friendly" robber, who promised to return again, according to E. W. Wingart, a friend, who has just returned from California. While Mr. Taylor was in England last May valuable jewelry, clothes and $800 in cash were taken from his apartment, Mr. Wingart said. Last Christmas week the apartment was entered again, the burglar leaving pawn checks for the jewelry and clothes previously stolen, and making off with more clothes and jewelry He left a note addressed to Taylor, which said: "Merry Christmas, shall return again. 
1922-02-03	MOVIE DIRECTOR FOUND MURDERED IN LOS ANGELES William Desmond Taylor of The Famous Players is Shot Dead in His Home. JEALOUSY MAY BE MOTIVE Police Working on That Theory, as No Attempt Was Made to Take Money or Valuables. HEAR SHOT, HOUR IN DOUBT Mabel Normand Tells of Leaving him Alive at 9 o'Clock After Conference on New Production. Spectal to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES, Feb, 2.- Los Angeles was shocked by another murder mystery today when the body of William Desmond Taylor, chief director of the Famous Players-Lasky studios, was found in his home with a bullet shot through his heart. Henry PeaVey a negro serwant, when he arrived this morning at the home where Taylor lived alone, found the body lying beside a desk, where Taylor had been going over a number of canceled checks he had received yesterday from the bank. Following a preliminary inquiry the police questioned Mabel Normand, the film actress. She and others were at Taylor's home at about 8:30 o'clock last night. Miss Normand said that she visited Taylor's bungalow early in the evening to discuss a new production, and that he escorted her to her automobile at the curb shortly before 9 o'clock. Taylor was to telephone to her later in the evening, Miss Normand said, but did not do so. It has been rumored for some months that Miss Normand was engaged to marry Taylor, but the rumors have never been confirmed. Conflicting Stories on Shot. Conflicting stories were told to the police as to the time of the shooting. According to Douglas McLean, who lives near by, he heard the shot at 9 o'clock. Another report was that the shooting occurred about 2 o'clock in the morning. Miss Edna Purviance, who lives in a house adjoining the Taylor bungalow, returned home about midnight last night and at that time, she said, saw a light burning in Taylor 's apartment, but thought nothing of it. Miss Purviance and Miss Normand were talking over the telephone this morning when Taylor's colored servant found the body and shouted "Murder! Murder!" McLean and his wife, who live near the Taylor home, stated that they heard a shot fired shortly after 9 o'clock. They described a strange man whom they saw in the street. The neighbors who heard the report believed it the backfire of an automobile, and they observed nothing in Bungalow Court, in which the Taylor residence is situated, that would lead them to believe there had been an unusual occurrence. The slayer evidently entered the house and shot Taylor as he was working on his check book. The moving picture director dropped to the floor and death was caused by an internal hemorrhage. Taylor's revolver was found in a drawer of the dresser in his bedroom on the second floor. It had not been discharged and none of his personal-effects had been disturbed. His jewelry, which was valued at several thousand dollars, was found in one of the dresser drawers by detectives. Tracing the movements of the suspected slayer, investigators last night located three witnesses who saw the man before and after the tragedy. Just after the report of the revolver was heard, Mrs. MacLean saw a man leaving the Taylor apartments. He was described as being about five feet nine or ten inches tall, medium built, roughly but not shabbily dressed in dark clothes and a plaid cap. Shortly before 6 o'clock a man answering this description stopped at the Hartley service station, corner of Sixth and Alvarado Strests, and inquired where W D. Taylor resided. Floyd Hartley, 331 South Bonnie Brae Avenue, and L. A. Grant, in charge of the station, were in the place at the time. Women acquaintances of the director will be questioned. The theory the police are working on is that a jealous woman either shot Taylor or had him shot. That a woman actually did the slaying is the more generally accepted theory. Taylor Accused Secretary. The police records show that when Taylor went to England a year ago on a business and pleasure trip he left his secretary, Edward F. Sands, in charge of his personal affairs. and that when  he returned he reported to Detective Sergeants Herman Cline and E. R. Cato, that Sands had robbed him of money, jewelry, clothing and a valuable automobile. A felony warrant was issued for Sands and the police say he was never found. A second robbery at the Taylor residence was attributed to Sands by the police. Robbery was evidently not the motive of the crime. A purse containing $78 was found lying in the desk beside the body and the slayer had made no efforts to take any articles from the house. When the body was found the neighbors called the Central Police station, and policemen who visited the scene turned in a report that Taylor had died as the result of hemorrhage, lt was not until Deputy Coroner William McDonald made a close inspection of the body that the bullet wound was discovered. The bullet had struck just below the neck on the left side and ranged downward through the heart. From the position of the wound, the detectives believe that Taylor was shot from behind. Among the mute evidences of what had taken place in the home before Taylor was shot is an expensive silver and cut glass drinking service. On it was a decanter, a shaker used in mixing drinks and two large glasses. In the glasses was some orange pulp, apparently left from an orange and gin concoction. A tray was littered with cigarette stubs. This service was found on the dining room table. The body was found in an adjoining room. Statement by Miss Normand. LOS ANGELES,, Cal., Feb. 2. "When I went to Mr. Taylor's home Wednesday evening, it was in response to a telephone call he had made to mine," Miss Normand said tonight. "I had my chaufffur drive me to Mr. Taylor 's home. I bought peanuts and some magazines and newspapers and ate the peanuts on the way. When I got out of my automobile I told any chauffeur to clean the car. Then I went up the steps. I heard Mr. Taylor talking to somebody over the phone, underreath the stairs, and I hesitated about going in until he had finished. Then I entered. He had been talking to a woman who had charge of the income tax business for many of the picture folk, including myself. He came in and said: 'Gee, I am glad to see you.' 'It was about five minutes after seven when I arrived at his house. We talked about books. I am studying French, and as he spoke French fluently, he was of great assistance to me. "I looked around the drawing room and told him I thought he had changed his house furnishilgs. He said: 'You haven 't been here for so long you forget.' I hadn't been to his house before for two months. He said: 'The phonograph is the only thing new.' "His servant, Henry, came in, and I said to Mr. Taylor: 'Have you had your dinner?' He said: 'Yes: have you had yours?' I said,  'No, but I'm tired and am going home now. I have a studio call for 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.' "He went with me to my car. He expressed surprise at some of the magazines in my car, and some were light, I suppose, and he gave me one of Freud 's books to read. He said he would phone me later in the evening to see how I liked it, but he did not. That was the last I ever heard his voice. When Edna Purviance told me this morning he was dead. I felt sure it was all some horrible mistake. I had known him for six or seven years. He was uniformly kind to every one." News of the death of Taylor stirred the motion picture colony here, and a group of directors and others prominent in the industry met tonight to consider offering a reward for the arrest and conviction of his slayer. Some of the efforts of the police tonight were directed to a search for the person who some time before Taylor's death wrote him a note enclosing pawn tickets for jewelry stolen from his home. The note apparently was written in Sacramento, Cal., Dec. 27, 1921. It read: "So sorry to inconvenience you, even temporarily. Also observe the lesson of the forced sale of assets. "A merry Christmas and a happy and prosperous New Year. (Signed) "ALIAS JIMMIE V." Mrs. Marjorie Berger, said to be an income tax expert, told the police, they stated, that Taylor had told her he had been receiving "mysterious" telephone calls. "Why don't you get somebody to watch?" Mrs. Berger said she asked him. that the Oh, no," she said Taylor replied, but did not explain his aversion to the procedure she had suggested. The theory of the police that a man lurked around the apartment until an opportunity presented itself for him to kill Tayier was said tonight to be reinforced by the discovery of six cigarette stubs in the alley adjoining the apartment. On a writing desk near the door of Taylor 's room were papers which indicated that Taylor had been preparing his income tax returns. On top of the desk was a picture of Miss Normand, and two others of the same actress were found in a conspicuous place in the apartment. Photographs of Mary Pickford and Mary Miles Minter also were in the apartment. Taylor had directed both of them. Soon after the death of Taylor became generally known, Miss Minter and her mother hurried to the apartment to learn if they could be of any assistance. Miss Minter was crying when she arrived, it was reported. Well known as Director. William D. Taylor was one of the best known motion-picture directors in this country. For several years he had been on the Hollywood staff of the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation. and was responsible for a number of that company's productions. His most favorably received work, perhaps, was his screen version of "Huckleberry Finn," which was first shown in New York at the Rivoli Theatre in February, 1920. He also directed Mary Pickford, when she was an Artcraft star, in. "Johanna Enlists" and "Captain Kidd Jr." Among the later pictures directed by him were several in which Mary Miles Minter was the principal player including "Judy of Rogues Harbor," "Nurse Marjorie" and "Jenny Be Good, "and two in which Ethel Clayton was the star, "Wealth" and "Beyond." He also directed "Sacred and Profane Love," with Elsie Ferguson in the leading role: "The Witching Hour," with Elliott Dexter at the head of the cast" "The Soul of Youth," featuring Lewis Sargent, and "The Furnace."

1922-02-04	Woman Tells Of Seeing Man Acting Suspiciously An excellent example of habitual observation was brought to light yesterday when Mrs. Ida Garrow, a modiste living at the Rose of Sharon Apartments, told Examiner investigators that on Wednesday night as she was walking down Ocean View avenue, at the intersection of Alvarado street, she noticed a man acting in a very peculiar manner. 'It was about EIGHT THIRTY, OR POSSIBLY TWENTY MINUTES OF NINE,' said Mrs. Garrow yesterday, 'Wednesday evening I was hurrying to my club which meets at the corner of Grand View and Ocean View avenue. I was late for a class that was studying Hebrew which I did not want to miss, but as I have trained my observational faculties in the study of astrology. It is without voluntary effort that I perceive whatever comes within the range of vision. 'As I came to Alvarado street, I saw a tall, slender, smooth shaven policeman, whose face I would instinctively recognize if I were to see him again, walking toward Ocean View avenue. Walking with him was another man, to whom I did not pay particular attention, because my curiosity was aroused by the peculiar actions of a man who was coming toward me a few feet in front of the policeman. Although the policeman was not paying the slightest attention to this man, the man was glancing back apprehensively over his shoulder, and at times looking in away from the street which would be directly in toward the court where the body of Mr. Taylor was found. 'As the policeman got closer to this man, the man crossed the street, and I noticed as he crossed that he was short and stout and wore a long overcoat, but there was the shadow of a building falling at such an angle that I could not determine whether he wore a cap or a hat.' Who was the policeman walking down Alvarado street at 8:30 or 8:45, and what did he see? This slight clue given by a careful observer may lead to very important developments in the mysterious murder whose points are now baffling the keenest detectives of the city.
1922-02-04	Mary Miles Minter talked yesterday at length on the subject uppermost in the minds of most members of Hollywood's film colony--the mysterious murder of William Desmond Taylor, noted film director. Seated in the little home in Hollywood in the presence of her mother, Mrs. Selby (sic) and her grandmother, Mrs. Mary Miles, the youthful screen star discussed intimately the details of her acquaintance with the man whose assassination shook the city Thursday morning. AND SHE DENIES, TOO, THAT SHE EVER WAS ENGAGED TO HIM OR THAT HE EVER HAD ASKED HER TO MARRY HIM. 'He looked on me as a mere child,' Miss Minter said. 'I could speak for hours, extolling his virtues and those qualities which he had that endeared him to his many friends--and then not be able to do him justice.' 'Married?' She repeated the interviewer's question. 'Married? I'm sure he wasn't, or he surely would have told me. We were such good friends.' Miss Minter had not seen Taylor for several months, she said, except perhaps on one or two occasions when they had passed each other on the street in their motors. 'After we came back from Europe, we just couldn't drag him away from his work,' she continued. 'He seemed to be wrapped up in it.' Discussing the report that Miss Normand and Taylor had been engaged at the time of his death, Miss Minter said she knew nothing of it. 'I hadn't heard of a romance between them,' she said, 'and I don't think the report is true. If it is true that he asked her to be his wife--well, I'm glad that he and Mabel were such good friends. She is a lovely girl. She is frank and earnest, and if she wishes to do a thing she does it. That's what I admire in her most.' She showed interest in the search which is being made for Edward F. Sands, Taylor's former valet. 'But it would be unfair to accuse him of the crime, without knowing,' she concluded. 'It is possible that some crank or demented person committed the crime. No one seems to know, except the person who did it. And whoever it was doesn't seem particularly eager to tell.'
1922-02-04	...Another report brought forward in motion picture circles here was that the director and Miss Normand had feared trouble of some sort and that they had made plans secretly to have a wedding to head it off. Miss Adla St. John [sic], writer on motion picture topics, who has just returned from a trip to the coast, said she had not heard of such premonitions. 'Mr. Taylor was one of the quietest and best liked men in the motion picture colony,' she said. 'His death came as a sudden shock to me, as it did to all his friends here. I don't know of his having had an enemy. Every player was delighted every time he heard he was going to be under Mr. Taylor's direction.'
1922-02-04	...Of almost equal interest in the development of the investigation was the statement of Mrs. Earl Tiffany, wife of Taylor's chauffeur, that she saw Edward F. Sands, ex-secretary-valet of the murdered director, now sought as a witness, at Sixth and Figueroa Streets Tuesday afternoon last [the day prior to the murder] at 1:20 o'clock. ...The search for Sands continued with unabated intensity. He is said to have returned to Los Angeles Tuesday and uttered this threat: 'I am here to get Bill Taylor.' His intimate knowledge of Taylor's double identity was revealed in startling fashion late yesterday when in Fresno it was learned that Sands had there pawned jewelry stolen from Taylor and that he had given the name 'William Deane-Tanner,' asserted to be Taylor's true name. ...The police are assured beyond peradventure that the man who pawned the jewelry in Fresno, using the true name of the owner in a spirit of malicious triumph, was Edward Sands. There is something in this very circumstance which to the officers is itself a flood of light coming out of the darkness. The stealing and forgery indulged in by Sands did not convey the spirit of this piece of treachery; they might have been only for gain. But now that the Fresno episode is brought up from the obscurity of a dark little hole-in- the-wall pawn shop to be made plain in all its details, a new element appears. This new element is the pronounced unfriendliness of Sands, which takes on the aspect of a sinister and silent threat. The malice is further revealed in what seems to have been a persistent campaign of Sands to annoy the director. From Fresno he sent him a pawn ticket, a ticket issued on valuables stolen from Taylor on which money had been raised. Still another pawn ticket came through the mail from Sacramento. With this was the letter signed 'Alias Jimmy V.' These were derisive thrusts at Taylor; from some motive which has not been revealed the thief and forger was trying to torture the victim of his crimes. ...Something of the description of this man was learned yesterday by The Examiner from A. A. Tomlinson, an accountant of 1022 West Fortieth Place. 'The true name of this man,' said Tomlinson, 'is not Sands but Strathmore. I recognized him by his picture in this morning's Examiner. 'He enlisted in the army during the war as Edward Fitz Strathmore and was assigned to Columbus Barracks, Ohio. I was then head of the finance office and upon learning that Strathmore had been a chief petty officer in the navy I asked that he be transferred to my department, which was done. 'On October 4, 1919, Strathmore forged my name to a Government check for $475 and tried to buy a motorcycle with it. He failed to carry out this scheme, but escaped. At the same time he forged the commanding officer's name to a discharge. He has been wanted for desertion. 'On July 4, 1920, I met him on Alvarado Street. He told me that he was expecting to get work with the street car company. I notified the police, but he disappeared. 'During his service with me at Columbus Barracks, Strathmore often boasted of the crimes he had committed. I did not believe him then, but thought it was a case of a young fellow drawing on his imagination. 'Once I asked him what he would do if he were in a dangerous situation. He said he would shoot his way out.'
1922-02-04	Additional details of the dual life led by William Desmond Taylor, motion picture director, murdered Wednesday night, were revealed last night when The Examiner located his sister-in-law, Mrs. Ada P. Deane-Tanner, in Monrovia. It was an extraordinary recitation which Mrs. Tanner related regarding the dead man. His real name, she said, was William Desmond [sic] Deane-Tanner and it was his brother, Dennis, that she married. Only twice in her life had she ever seen this mysterious figure, known to Hollywood and to the picture world as William D. Taylor. Once was on the birth of her daughter, 13 years ago, in New York city, when he came to see his brother's child and wife on her hospital bed. The other time was in Los Angeles, six years ago, when she went to the studio to find him. According to this woman's story, as she told it in her little Monrovia home last night, William D. Taylor, the director, during the past six years and up to his death absolutely refused to admit he was her brother-in-law, and yet, when her health broke down a [sic] years ago he began sending her a monthly allowance, which she was receiving regularly up to the time of his death. He wouldn't admit that he was her relative but he supported her, though never seeing her. A more astounding part of the story is Mrs. Deane-Tanner's recital of the manner in which her own husband in 1912 disappeared from sight never to be seen again. 'I don't know whether he is alive today or not,' she said. 'William D. Taylor's brother left me for the office one day and never was heard from or seen since. 'I asked Mr. Taylor, as he called himself here, about my husband's disappearance in letters to him, but he said that he had not (in 1921) seen or heard from my husband for fourteen years. This I know wasn't so, as my husband was by my side when my brother-in-law called on me at the birth of my daughter, twelve years before, in 1921, now thirteen years ago.' Mrs. Deane-Tanner refused to say what her husband's business was, but intimated that he had a considerable income. When he disappeared, she said, she spent a small fortune trying to find him, in detective bills and in other ways, but though she had the earth scoured to the best of her ability in an effort to trace the man, she was never able to get an inkling of what happened to him in those minutes between his leaving their home and the time when he should have--but never did-- arrive at his office... When Mrs. Deane-Tanner six years ago heard from a friend here that her brother-in-law was in Hollywood under an assumed name, she went to the studio to find him. She finally, she said, secured an interview with him, but he persistently refused to admit he was Deane-Tanner, though she was positive he was the same man who stood above her bedside an smiled at her new-born baby. So she left and had nothing more to do with Taylor-Tanner until her health began to fail a year ago. She had a 12-year-old daughter with her and was in need of funds, having spent all she had searching for her husband and educating her daughter. So she again went to Taylor or Tanner, this time writing him and telling him of her predicament. He replied to her, again denying that he had ever been Tanner, but at the same time he sent her a check and ever since has been giving an allowance.
1922-02-04	...Mrs. Deane-Tanner in Monrovia said the last check from Mr. Taylor came about January 20, last. She said she came to Monrovia nine years ago and got in touch with him six years ago, appealing to him for help.
1922-02-04	What the police regard as an important clue was discovered this afternoon. Detectives are investigating 'a dope party' given at Hollywood recently, at which cocaine and other drugs were served instead of drinks. Two women, both film actresses, stated that they quarreled over Taylor and fought, ripping the clothes from each other's bodies. Taylor was not present at the party. The police theory is that Taylor's murder was contrived by one of the women, to whose advances he had refused to respond...
1922-02-04	A motion picture actress whose name has thus far not been mentioned in connection with the murder of William Desmond Taylor, famous film director, late last night was the center of investigation of the combined forces of detectives detailed to solve the mystery of the slaying. Mr. Taylor was shot to death within a few minutes after Mabel Normand left his home last Wednesday night. For almost four hours the detectives closely questioned former employees of Mr. Taylor in an endeavor to check details of their new theory of the crime, which, they still believe, was inspired by a revenge motive with jealousy as the probable cause. Throughout the long questioning, which was conducted in the Detective Bureau of Central Police Station, every attempt was made to find out all facts regarding the past life and recent movements of Mr. Taylor. His friendship with such prominent motion-picture stars as Mabel Normand, Mary Miles Minter and Claire Windsor was discussed in detail. Many new features of his life were disclosed during the examination of these former employees. With the motion-picture actress mentioned last night the name of a director also was linked. The officers believe these two persons may be able to aid materially in clearing up the case. Throughout this investigation, however, efforts of the detectives were also directed toward finding Edward F. sands, former secretary and who was made defendant in a complaint in which Mr. Taylor charged him with forgery. Sands was in Los Angeles, the police believe, both on the day of the shooting and also the day before. Another witness saw him several days before the crime, they say. From Mrs. Earl Tiffany, wife of a former chauffeur of Mr. Taylor, it was learned she saw Sands last Tuesday, the day before the shooting. This meeting was in another part of the city, far removed from 404-B South Alvarado street, where Mr. Taylor, shot in the back, was found Thursday morning. Another witness is said to have seen Sands on South Alvarado street the night of the murder. These clews have caused the investigators to redouble their efforts to find the former employee, because they believe he can throw valuable light on the life of Mr. Taylor. Earl Tiffany, who was chauffeur for Mr. Taylor until a short time after Tiffany says he told Mr. Taylor he believed he would keep a record of the trips on which he took him, also was questioned. Mr. Tiffany added many clews to the few already in the possession of the detectives. He related in detail, as he remembered the incidents, many supposed facts concerning Mr. Taylor's friendship for Mary Miles Minter, film star whom he formerly directed, then for Mabel Normand, also an actress, and before either of them another woman whose activities are now being investigated by the police. After Mr. Tiffany was questioned, Harry Fellows, assistant director for Mr. Taylor and brother of Howard Fellows, Mr. Taylor's last chauffeur, was taken to the room with the detectives. He was closeted for a long time. In the meanwhile his wife and sister-in-law waited impatiently outside for him. Mr. Fellows is understood to have told the officers he could remember few details that might aid them. He formerly was chauffeur fro Mr. Taylor, but is asserted to have declared he could not recall the names of some of the persons about whom the detectives wanted to know. Mr. Tiffany was chauffeur for Mr. Taylor until last July. He had considerable experience as a chauffeur for another prominent motion-picture man during an exciting night just preceding an action for divorce filed by the latter's wife. Because of this experience, Mr. Tiffany says, he remarked to Mr. Taylor one day that he believed he would keep a diary on the trips he made so that he could know just where he went every day and would have record of it. Mr. Taylor said nothing, Mr. Tiffany says, but in a fortnight told Mr. Tiffany he would not require his services longer. Mr. and Mrs. Tiffany, both of whom know Sands personally and are familiar with his habits and opinions, believe he will be able to throw little light on the case except inasmuch as Mr. Taylor's past life may aid in solving the mystery. In telling of the incidents in Mr. Taylor's life which he observed, Mr. Tiffany said Mary Miles Minter formerly was a favored friend of Mr. Taylor. No other girl appeared to enter into Mr. Taylor's attentions. Later, a change came about, according to Mr. Tiffany, and on occasions when Miss Minter called at the Taylor house, Sands told her Mr. Taylor was not at home, when in fact, he was. About this time Mabel Normand came in for more and more attention from Mr. Taylor, the chauffeur's story continues. She was still the ruling favorite among the friends of Mr. Taylor, when Mr. Tiffany left his employ. In connection with this fact, Henry Peavey, negro houseman of the slain man, and who was questioned by the police again yesterday, said Mr. Taylor told him that if Miss Normand telephoned between 5 and 6 o'clock on the night of the slaying he was home, but if anyone else called he was not. Detective Sergeants Herman Cline, Winn, Murphy, Cato and Cahill, were active in the further questioning that took place last night... The name of Claire Windsor, motion-picture star who once was reported engaged to Charlie Chaplin, was thrust into the investigation when it was learned that she had been out riding and to a dinner with Mr. Taylor a week or so before the murder. It was the first time she had ever been out with him, her mother stated yesterday. The officers expressed a wish to ascertain whether she knew of any possible enemies, but Miss Windsor could not be located. The Coroner's inquest will be held this morning at 10 o'clock at the Ivy Overholtzer undertaking establishment. Several film celebrities have been subpoenaed to appear at the inquest. Mabel Normand, film actress, again was questioned by the police. No additional information was obtained, it was stated. Miss Normand relating again that she left Mr. Taylor's flat about 7:45 or 7:50 o'clock on the night of the murder and that Mr. Taylor accompanied her to her automobile. In this she was corroborated by her negro [sic] chauffeur, William Davis, also subpoenaed for the inquest. Mr. Taylor was shot, the police believe, within a very few minutes after Miss Normand left. The District Attorney's office swung into action in the case when a survey of the premises was made under the direction of Chief Dep. Dist.-Atty. Doran. Investigators from that office also were working on the mystery. Information was sought from Mary Miles Minter, a film-actress friend, who rushed to the house, becoming almost hysterical when she confirmed the report she had received Thursday morning that Mr. Taylor was murdered. Little information of value was obtained from her. The efforts to locate Miss Windsor yesterday assumed a peculiar turn. At her home her mother stated Miss Windsor was out on location with Marshall Neilan. At the studios of Mr. Neilan it was stated he was on location, but that Miss Windsor was not. Her mother said Miss Windsor had been with Mr. Taylor recently, but that for the last week has been very busy on location, being compelled to work late at night and into the early morning. For this reason she has been sleeping at the studio, and had not been home except at rare intervals, she stated. Charles Maigne, director at the Lasky studio, was closeted for more than an hour yesterday afternoon with Captain of Detectives Moffatt. The nature of the conference was not divulged. The motion-picture colony yesterday continued to seethe with the mystery of how and why Mr. Taylor, one of the leading figures in the industry, was murdered. Many rumors and reports connecting names of film stars in a way tending to show they may know something of the motives of the slayer were received during the day by the investigators...
1922-02-04	Witnesses at the inquest will include many nationally known persons who have been interviewed by police detectives concerning their knowledge of the crime. Those subpoenaed yesterday by Detective Sergt. Jack Wallis include the following: Mabel Normand, one of the best-known comediennes in the motion-picture profession and who was the last known person to have seen and talked with Mr. Taylor before his death. She had visited his home to get a book he had purchased for her and left his apartment only a few minutes before the time of his murder. Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of a widely known motion-picture star, whose front door is only a few paces from Mr. Taylor's apartment. Mrs. MacLean, upon hearing a shot, opened her door, looked out and saw a man leaving the Taylor apartments. She is the only person who has given the investigators an unquestioned first-hand description of the slayer. Charles Eyton, general manager of the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, and the fourth husband of Kathlyn Williams, also a motion-picture star. Mr. Eyton, a personal friend of the slain man, was one of the first persons to arrive at the Taylor apartments and conducted an inventory of the murdered man's property. Verne Dumas, wealthy oil man, who also was one of the first neighbors to enter the apartment. William Davis, Miss Normand's chauffeur, who drove her to Mr. Taylor's home. His story corroborates that of his employer. Henry Peavey, colored servant employed by Mr. Taylor, who first discovered the body and who will relate incidents pertaining to the finding of the body. Howard Fellows, chauffeur for Mr. Taylor, who is expected to corroborate the time of the murder. Mr. Fellows visited the Taylor apartment at 8 p.m. on the night of the crime and though the home was lighted in all rooms he received no response at the door. He later called his employer on the telephone but failed to arouse anybody. E. J. Jessrund [sic], owner of the apartment occupied by Mr. Taylor and a neighbor who was one of the first to respond to Peavey's cries of 'murder.' Autopsy Surgeon Wagner, who will relate his findings in diagnosing the cause of Mr. Taylor's death.
1922-02-04	Did William D. Taylor, murdered film director of nation-wide fame, fear the fate in store for him and take every precaution the last few days of his life to surround his movements and whereabouts with utmost secrecy? This was the question asked yesterday by the investigators in their effort to reconstruct the circumstances that led to the slaying of the famous director in his palatial flat on Alvarado street last Wednesday night. A clew that led the officers to believe Taylor was uneasy about something in the days immediately preceding the shooting, was given to Detective Sergeants Cline, Murphy, Winn and Ziegler, yesterday, by Henry Peavey, colored porter and housekeeper for Taylor. Peavey was taken to the detective bureau of Central Police Station yesterday afternoon and there questioned by the officers on the case. His examination followed that of Howard Fellows, chauffeur for Mr. Taylor, and from information obtained by the officers from the two men, who knew intimate details of the slain film man's life, the officers obtained important tips. The most significant part of the new statement made by Peavey yesterday was that Taylor left the house on a mysterious call Wednesday afternoon, leaving the automobile behind. 'Mr. Taylor left the house about 5 o'clock, saying he wanted to walk, and leaving strict orders not to answer any telephone inquiries to the house with one exception,' said Peavey. 'He said that if Miss Normand called to tell her he would be back after 6 o'clock, but instructed me to tell everyone else he was out and that I did not know where he was or when he would be back.' From the few papers and documents obtained by them at the Taylor flat, the officers working on the case yesterday sought to glean, if possible, some clew as to where Taylor went when he left the house Wednesday afternoon. Names and addresses, recorded by Mr. Taylor, of a number of well-known persons in the film world and in business circles here are in the possession of the police, and a thorough check of these will be made in an effort to trace accurately and completely every movement of the slain film director on the days before his murder.
1922-02-04	What may prove to be an important clew in the hunt for the murderer of William D. Taylor was placed before the police last night in a report that a large automobile of striking appearance was seen in the vicinity of the Taylor home the night of the slaying. This automobile, according to the reports to the police, was an expensive car painted a chocolate-brown shade. The automobile, according to the reports, was seen to drive up to the Taylor home late in the afternoon and remain there for some time. It left the corner of Alvarado and Maryland streets a few minutes after the automobile of Miss Mabel Normand drove up. A peculiar part of this episode is a conflicting report from another source that an automobile described as a closed car, dark green in color, was the vehicle in question. The time and location given in the two reports check in every detail, but the make of car and color of the bodies are different. 'We are going to check every possible angle of this case,' Detective Sergeant Herman Cline said yesterday. 'There are a great many conflicting reports given us and for the first few days it is a large task to distinguish the important from what has no connection with the case. If we can verify certain facts laid before us in connection with this murder, then the description of these two cars will become very important.' This is the only comment the officers on the case would make on this phase of the investigation. The importance of the clew about the automobile described is that the police believe they may be able to trace the owners and from them learn either of visits to Mr. Taylor's apartment or about persons seen loitering in the vicinity of the place.
1922-02-04	The District Attorney's office swung into action yesterday in an attempt to solve the mystery of the murder of William Desmond Taylor and also to lay a foundation for future prosecution in the event the slayer is captured. At the same time the police searched Mr. Taylor's apartments at 404-B South Alvarado street, and took charge of letters, papers and documents that might serve to thrown some light on the slain film director's affairs. Chief Dep. Dist.-Atty. Doran and Investigator Contreras made a thorough search of the apartments, and canvass of the vicinity. Albert E. Timmons of the County Surveyor's office and two assistants, P. W. Atkins and R. B. Heuer, drew plans of each room and the territory contiguous to the residence. Detective Sergeants Herman W. Cline, Winn and Murphy, represented the police department in the search of the premises. Papers belonging to Mr. Taylor were taken to Central Police Station and carefully examined. The arrangement of the furniture in the room where the fatal shot was fired was not disturbed, as the officers stated a careful scrutiny would be made for possible finger prints. This phase of the investigation applies particularly in the chair in which Mr. Taylor was possibly sitting when shot, and which was found turned over across his legs. Mr. Taylor's apartments were tastefully furnished. There were books in profusion, mostly of a philosophical and sociological trend, numerous photographs of persons in the motion-picture colony, relics of the war, and much art work and bric-a-brac. The police yesterday questioned four persons found by The Times who had seen a man believed to be the slayer go to the Taylor residence before the shooting and leave the vicinity a few minutes after the bullet had been fired. The time of the murder has been fixed by police at between 7:49 and 8:15 p.m. Wednesday. L. A. Grant and Floyd Hartley, service station men, at Sixth and Alvarado streets, stated that a man had inquired of them where W. D. Taylor lived shortly before 6 o'clock. They directed him to the Alvarado street address, and he left. The description of this man corresponds with that of a man who boarded an inbound West First-street car at the Maryland-avenue stop, at either 7:54 or 8:25 p.m. Motorman R. S. Woodward and Conductor E. W. Dascomb took notice of the passenger because it was the first stop they had made on Maryland street for months. The man was described by these four persons as about five feet and nine or ten inches tall, 26 or 27 years old and weighing between 155 and 165 pounds. He had dark hair and wore a dark suit and either a light hat or cap. ...Floyd Hartley yesterday was unable to identify a picture of Sands as the man who inquired at the oil station. He was inclined to think they were different individuals, but was not positive. While the revenge and jealousy theories appear to be the most plausible thus far in the investigation the police are not overlooking the possibility of a blackmail angle. This factor is being probed by detectives detailed to the case. It is considered possible that the slayer attempted to extort money from Mr. Taylor and when refused or threatened with arrest, he shot to kill. An open checkbook on Mr. Taylor's writing desk and a pen with fresh ink on it might be considered part of a ruse by Mr. Taylor to 'stall off' the murderer until the police could be advised. The story that a woman is involved in the slaying--supplying the motive of jealousy--is seriously entertained by the police. Although the slain man led a fairly studious life it is known that he had a wide circle of women acquaintances and that some of them were visitors to his home. An enraged suitor who had been discarded might very easily have carried out this plan, it is believed, to eliminate Mr. Taylor as a rival. In order to ferret out a revenge motive, for some real or fancied wrong, the police say they will have to trace back the incidents in Mr. Taylor's life. He led a varied and exciting career that took him to many out-of-the- way places of the globe. Investigators feel confident that he must have incurred some bitter enmity during his activities and travels.
1922-02-04	Mute evidence of the tender affection which existed between Ethel Daisy Taylor, 14-year-old daughter of the slain film director, William Desmond Taylor, and her father, was found by The Examiner yesterday. Inscribed on a page and a half of note paper, written in typical school girl chatter, it bears every evidence of the strong devotion that undoubtedly existed. Postmark Mamaroneck, N. Y., and dated February 6, 1921, the letter reads: 'Dear Father of Mine: 'Excuse the weird paper, but I am having some made and haven't gotten it as yet. I like your paper very much and am always glad when I hear from you. 'I have read your letters over ever and ever so many times until I almost know them by heart. I would have answered sooner, only I have had a siege of infected fingers. Three, one right after the other, and have only just gotten through with them. 'Of course, that made it rather difficult to write or draw, so I stayed home a couple of the days. I had one of the fingers cut four times, but the others only once. 'Mercy goodness, I wish you didn't have to work so long. You'll wear yourself down again, so be careful, won't you, Papa, pettie dear? Will the picture with Miss Compson be interesting? I do wish I might see you soon. I think of you so much it seems as if I saw you much more often than every once in a while. 'I realize how seldom we really see each other and I surely do hope you'll be East again soon, dear. I'd like very much to send you some real nice things for Christmas, but haven't the least idea what you would like, so kindly tell me, please, dear. 'I must stop now. Oh, Father, dear, I do love you so much. 'Ethel.'
1922-02-04	The names of two film actresses were injected last night into the investigation of the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery. One is a star of national reputation. The other is a girl of humbler station in motion picture ranks. While detectives working on the case refused to confirm the above mentioned facts it was learned from other sources that investigation had disclosed a close association between Taylor and these two screen actresses. Of almost equal interest in the development of the investigation was the statement of Mrs. Earl Tiffany, wife of Taylor's chauffeur, that she saw Edward F. Sands, ex-secretary-valet of the murdered director, now sought as a witness, at Sixth and Figueroa Streets Tuesday afternoon last [the day prior to the murder] at 1:20 o'clock. Mr. and Mrs. Tiffany were subjected to a long examination last night, during which she revealed what the investigators [regard] as one of the most important clews yet to come before them. In regard to the screen actresses, the police refused to make any mention of their names or to discuss what part they are alleged to have played in the mystery. Until a late hour last night police detectives questioned Harry Fellows, Taylor's assistant director. They are said to regard Fellows as one of the vital witnesses in the case because of his close contact with Taylor for many months. The questioning last night, they said, was for the purpose of checking over Taylor's movements for three days preceding his murder. The search for Sands continued with unabated intensity. He is said to have returned to Los Angeles Tuesday and uttered this threat: 'I am here to get Bill Taylor.' His intimate knowledge of Taylor's double identity was revealed in startling fashion late yesterday when in Fresno it was learned that Sands had there pawned jewelry stolen from Taylor and that he had given the name 'William Deane-Tanner,' asserted to be Taylor's true name. The jewelry upon which a loan had been made and a ticket issued consisted of a pair of cuff links set with diamonds and onyx shirt studs, also set with diamonds. The man who secured the loan answered the description of Sands. In a bold hand he wrote on the ticket retained by the broker the name of his one-time employer, 'William Deane Tanner.' The meaning of this might have remained impenetrable, something as deep as the shadows as all else that concerns the silent figure whose tragic end left the motion picture world aghast and stunned. But by some means, possibly by reading his mail, it is believed, and learning the details of the allowances sent to his daughter, Sands became possessed of the secret. It may be said, parenthetically, that no member of the picture colony believes the change in name was for any purpose of concealment. Taylor (and that name will be used as most accurate) said not long ago to a friend, 'I have known great sadness in my life.' It is believed that the 'Tanner' was discarded along with the old life which he had described as being so unhappy. The police are assured beyond peradventure that the man who pawned the jewelry in Fresno, using the true name of the owner in a spirit of malicious triumph, was Edward Sands. There is something in this very circumstance which to the officers is itself a flood of light coming out of the darkness. The stealing and forgery indulged in by Sands did not convey the spirit of this piece of treachery; they might have been only for gain. But now that the Fresno episode is brought up from the obscurity of a dark little hole-in- the-wall pawn shop to be made plain in all its details, a new element appears. This new element is the pronounced unfriendliness of Sands, which takes on the aspect of a sinister and silent threat. The malice is further revealed in what seems to have been a persistent campaign of Sands to annoy the director. From Fresno he sent him a pawn ticket, a ticket issued on valuables stolen from Taylor on which money had been raised. Still another pawn ticket came through the mail from Sacramento. With this was the letter signed 'Alias Jimmy V.' These were derisive thrusts at Taylor; from some motive which has not been revealed the thief and forger was trying to torture the victim of his crimes. Chief of Police Frank Truex of Fresno, who found the pawned jewelry, learned that other articles stolen from Taylor and not recovered were pledged in Sacramento. It was disclosed yesterday that Mabel Normand recently made Taylor a present of a black amber cigarette holder valued at $1800. This is said to be one of the finest things of its kind ever made. In return Taylor gave Miss Normand a dresser set costing $1200. ...'We are satisfied that we have everything checked up to 8 o'clock on the night of the murder. 'The man who killed William D. Taylor is the one who was seen leaving his apartment shortly before that time Wednesday night. This is our absolute conclusion. 'We also have a definite clew as to who the man is and his motive. But to reveal either, would be to prevent clear and straightaway police work upon our hypothesis.' This was the statement last night of Captain of Detectives David L. Adams, after receiving reports from his staff of detectives who yesterday were combing through a multitude of rumors for something substantial. Sands, whose true name, The Examiner yesterday learned, is Edward Fitz Strathmore, wanted for desertion from the Army as well as for the robberies committed against Taylor, was seen in Los Angeles Tuesday. Hunted as a fugitive by both Federal and State officers, he nevertheless ran the gauntlet, appearing, it is said, without attempt at concealment either of his person or his plan. It is the latter which particularly interests the police. To a man who has given a detailed report of the conversation Sands is said to have threatened, with a curse, 'I'm here to get Bill Taylor.' Included among the persons who saw Sands on Tuesday are women whose testimony will probably be of the utmost importance if he is apprehended. One of these is said to have seen him Wednesday night near the scene of the crime. Her identity is being kept secret. There are so many fingers pointing at this man that the police have centered their efforts upon finding him. With the little light as to the relations between Taylor and Sands it is admittedly difficult to reconstruct the tragedy upon the basis merely of the discharged man's enmity growing out of Taylor's felony complaint against him. Hence, as a working theory, it is presumed that there may have been a much deeper motive underlying the act. That Taylor was not shot in the back, as at first reported, but in the left side, was yesterday discovered by Detectives Cato and Cahill, who minutely examined the wound. The single bullet entered at a point where the left elbow would rest if the arm were held naturally at the side. It might seem, therefore, that Taylor, hearing a noise in his room, turned from his writing desk where he was going over the stubs of his check book, and was shot on the moment he discovered the intruder. ...There is, however, a great mass of material upon which the police are checking, hoping that from the pile of chaff there may be found the single grain of information which, it is hoped, may germinate into the full disclosure of the dastardly act and all of its ramifications. Theodore Kosloff, the dancer, contributed one of these stories. Some two weeks ago he was with Taylor 'on location,' a place in the country. They were walking together. Suddenly from behind a clump of brush a man arose almost with a spring. Quicker than this surprising stranger, said Kosloff, was Taylor. He leaped around to one side and faced the man. They stood eye to eye for a moment, neither speaking. Then the man turned and walked away. Taylor, vouchsafing no explanation, continued the interrupted conversation. This unaccountable happening came to Mr. Kosloff's mind yesterday when he learned of his friend's violent end. But aside from relating the peculiar circumstances he could add nothing. ...Something of the description of this man was learned yesterday by The Examiner from A. A. Tomlinson, an accountant of 1022 West Fortieth Place. 'The true name of this man,' said Tomlinson, 'is not Sands but Strathmore. I recognized him by his picture in this morning's Examiner. 'He enlisted in the army during the war as Edward Fitz Strathmore and was assigned to Columbus Barracks, Ohio. I was then head of the finance office and upon learning that Strathmore had been a chief petty officer in the navy I asked that he be transferred to my department, which was done. 'On October 4, 1919, Strathmore forged my name to a Government check for $475 and tried to buy a motorcycle with it. He failed to carry out this scheme, but escaped. At the same time he forged the commanding officer's name to a discharge. He has been wanted for desertion. 'On July 4, 1920, I met him on Alvarado Street. He told me that he was expecting to get work with the street car company. I notified the police, but he disappeared. 'During his service with me at Columbus Barracks, Strathmore often boasted of the crimes he had committed. I did not believe him then, but thought it was a case of a young fellow drawing on his imagination. 'Once I asked him what he would do if he were in a dangerous situation. He said he would shoot his way out. 'Strathmore gave me a number of books, all bearing his signature on the inside of the cover. In each case the 'Strathmore' was written over a name which had been erased. In one of them I was able to make out that the erased name was 'Sands.' 'Among the volumes is one bearing, in Strathmore's handwriting, the entry, 'c-o Perry P. Le Berthon, 982 Fifty-second street, Brooklyn, N. Y.' The Examiner wired to Columbus barracks for a description of Strathmore and received the following: 'Dark complexion, ruddy face, height 5 feet 5 3/4 inches, slightly bow- legged.' Strathmore, or Sands, is a constant cigarette smoker. ...Recently, it was learned, Taylor had attended two or three 'hop' parties where all but he had either smoked opium or taken a drug in some form. He was there, it was assumed, to get 'atmosphere' for a picture. The possibility that the beginning of the tragedy had its setting at one of these proscribed affairs is being considered. ...The many friends of Taylor in the motion picture colony found it inconceivable, they said, that he should have been mixed up with a woman, particularly in such a way as to incur some one's mortal hostility.
1922-02-04	Neva Gerber, petite and beautiful film star, who at one time was engaged to marry William D. Taylor, but who broke off the match because she said both believed it unsuitable, said last night: 'I have never known a finer, better man than Mr. Taylor. He was the soul of honor, a man of exceptional culture, education and refinement, but possessing a reserve which very few were permitted to penetrate. 'So far as I know, he did not have an enemy in the world, although he had mentioned casually of fights he had on his various trips to the Klondike. 'He had led a most eventful life, and told me, on one occasion, of being in a village in the far north when it was scourged by smallpox. He went about nursing the inhabitants, including a priest. The epidemic was a severe one, and practically every one was stricken, or had fled to escape this pest. Finally he and the priest, I think it was, were the only two left. The priest had fallen a victim, but Mr. Taylor nursed him back to health. 'Then Mr. Taylor fell victim to the disease, and, after a hard battle, the priest nursed him back to health. 'In spite of this experience, he often said to me that he longed for the far north with its great open stretches, its mighty mountains, and the solitude of its hills and valleys. Often when he was nervous and tired from directing a picture he would tell me that he longed again to be going over the trail in search of gold, and far from the distractions of civilization. 'He told me that he made two fortunes, and spent both of them on his return from Alaska. 'Before the war he frequently received letters from his mother who was then in London, and his daughter, who I believe was then about 11 years old. His mother, I understood, was killed in an air raid on the British capital. 'He always spoke of his daughter as 'the child,' and was planning, about two years ago, to bring her to Los Angeles to live. It is my understanding that his former wife is now living in New York. 'I always assumed he was divorced, for had he not been, I do not believe he would have asked me to marry him. We were engaged for some time, but we finally came to the conclusion we were not suited to one another, so the prospective match was broken off about two years ago. This terrible affair is all the more mysterious because it was a common saying among the studios and in Hollywood generally that Mr. Taylor had not an enemy in the world. 'He may have made an enemy in the past who nursed a grudge through the years which finally resulted in this murder, but he never gave the slightest indication to me of having any foes.'
1922-02-04	Mabel Normand, one of the last persons to see William D. Taylor alive when she visited his Alvarado street home Wednesday evening to borrow a book on philosophy, denied emphatically today that she was or ever had been engaged to Taylor. 'We were pals of the golf course, fellow students in French and both enjoyed delving into philosophical subjects--that was my relation with Mr. Taylor. Just pals,' she said. Miss Normand was recovering this afternoon from a nervous collapse which she suffered when told of Taylor's murder. 'I wish to deny also the statement attributed to me that Mr. Taylor had told me of premonition of his death,' added Miss Normand. 'I never heard him mention any fear for his life or fear of any person or persons. 'Although we were good pals and had many interests in common, I was so slightly acquainted with his personal affairs that not until I read it in the papers did I know that Mr. Taylor had a daughter.'...
1922-02-04	Mary Miles Minter, motion picture star, who said she had always considered him the 'most perfect man' and who was one of the first to call at the Taylor residence after the murder became known, said: 'It is ridiculous for any one to intimate that Mr. Taylor and I were ever interested in each other in a sentimental way. 'I have known Mr. Taylor since I was a little girl. He has directed me in some of my best pictures and I have always loved and admired him almost as one would a father. 'Immediately after mother told me of his murder we hurried to his home. I have often been there with my mother or grandmother and when I came fact to face with Henry, his colored servant, I burst into tears yesterday. 'One newspaper said I had hysterics,' continued Miss Minter. 'Perhaps I did. Mr. Taylor was an old friend of the family and I have known him ever since I was a child playing child parts. 'I used so often to call Henry, his faithful servant, over the telephone and ask him if Mr. Taylor had remembered to eat his dinner, or to tell him to be sure that Mr. Taylor had plenty of covers on his bed, as it was a cold night. 'As far as I know, Mr. Taylor was never married. 'I do not believe that he was engaged to Mabel Normand. Miss Normand and myself are very good friends and I am sure I would have known had they been planning to marry. I think that Mr. Taylor found Miss Normand a lovable and rather boyish pal and that was all there was to it. 'For the last three and a half years I have known Mr. Taylor very well, although during the last five months or so I have scarcely seen him, having been so busy with my work. He directed me in 'Anne of Green Gables,' Judy of Rogues Hollow' [sic], 'Nurse Marjorie,' and 'Jenny be Good.' 'Mr. Taylor was always the man we all pointed to when any one asked us to name a representative man of the profession. 'No, I never heard him mention having any fear of any one, and I am positive he had no premonition of trouble. 'I have wept hours since his death and I expect to weep a great deal more. For Mr. Taylor was one of the most splendid and fine men that I ever expect to know.'
1922-02-04	An excellent example of habitual observation was brought to light yesterday when Mrs. Ida Garrow, a modiste living at the Rose of Sharon apartments, told Examiner investigators that on Wednesday night as she was walking down Ocean View avenue, at the intersection of Alvarado street, she noticed a man acting in a very peculiar manner. 'It was about eight thirty, or possibly twenty minutes of nine, said Mrs. Garrow yesterday, 'Wednesday evening and I was hurrying to my club which meets at the corner of Grand View and Ocean View avenues. I was late for a class that is studying Hebrew which I did not want to miss, but as I have trained my observational faculties in the study of astrology it is without voluntary effort that I perceive whatever comes within the range of vision. 'As I came to Alvarado street, I saw a tall, slender, smooth shaven policeman, whose face I would instantly recognize if I were to see him again, walking toward Ocean View avenue. Walking with him was another man, to whom I did not pay any particular attention, because my curiosity was aroused by the peculiar actions of a man who was coming toward me a few feet in front of the policeman. Although the policeman was not paying the slightest attention to this man, the man was glancing back apprehensively over his shoulder, and at times looking in, away from the street, which would be directly in toward the court where the body of Mr. Taylor was found. 'As the policeman got closer to this man, the man crossed the street, and I noticed as he crossed that he was short and stout and wore a long overcoat, but there was the shadow of a building falling at such an angle that I could not determine whether he wore a cap or a hat.' Who was the policeman walking down Alvarado street at 8:30 or 8:45, and what did he see? This slight clue given by a careful observer may lead to very important developments in the mysterious murder, whose points are still baffling the keenest detectives of the city.
1922-02-04	Claire Windsor, beautiful motion-picture star, last night added a sensation to the mystery of the slaying of William D. Taylor, the popular picture director. She asserted that she had heard the dead motion picture director declare that 'he would kill Sands, the former valet, if he ever laid his hands on him.' 'Mr. Taylor, Tony Moreno and Betty Francisco were at the Ambassador Hotel at a party on Thursday night one week ago when Maurice, the famous dancer, first gave his exhibition,' said the film actress. 'Mr. Taylor was with me, and of course we talked about the robbery. 'He said: 'If I ever lay my hands on Sands I will kill him.' 'Mr. Taylor seemed very determined because Sands had robbed him of every cent he had at the time. Speaking of her friendship with Taylor, whom she referred to in terms of the greatest respect, Miss Windsor said that she had known him a long time but never very well. 'I always found him a perfect gentleman, always considerate of others and most polished,' she said. 'While I never worked under the direction of Mr. Taylor, I met him a number of times. Mr. Taylor made no secret of his plan to kill his valet, as he told a number of people that he would kill him if he ever got his hands on him.' Pretty Betty Francisco, the little blonde motion picture star, yesterday told of the party she attended at the Ambassador Hotel when Antonio Moreno was her escort and the late picture director was the companion of Claire Windsor. She referred to the slaying of Taylor with horror. 'I did not know him intimately enough to call him a friend, but I would be proud to call a man like him my friend. I was rather an acquaintance, and not fortunate enough to be a friend. 'It has been stated that I was with Mr. Taylor at the Ambassador Hotel. This, however, is not true. I was at the hotel with Mr. and Mrs. Bryant Washburn. Mr. Moreno and Miss Claire Windsor also were at the Ambassador, but I did not see Mr. Taylor. 'I never recall his speaking of any trouble he had with any one, but on one occasion he spoke of a servant of his who was taken ill with tuberculoses. He felt very badly about it. This must have been nearly two years ago. Last night at the home of Claire Windsor, 1042 Third avenue, the mother of the film actress told of the many books Taylor had recommended to her daughter to read.
1922-02-04	The women attracting most interest from investigators now are Mabel Normand, Mary Miles Minter, Claire Windsor and Mrs. Clara Crawford Ivers [sic]. He was a close friend to all of them. In addition he was known as a man who fascinated women. The police, therefore, are seeking not only the actual slayer, but the person behind the slayer, if two were involved.
1922-02-04	Despite her denial of a love affair with William D. Taylor, a close friend of both Mabel Normand and the slain man said yesterday that Miss Normand had been engaged to the director. While nothing definite had been settled it was generally understood, according to this source, that they were to marry. 'Of course, Miss Normand was much sought after by young men in Los Angeles,' said this informant. 'But I'm quite sure none of these affairs was serious. Miss Normand simply would have a pleasant evening with one of them at a dance or a party, and promptly forget all about it. If the young man called her by telephone afterward, as likely as not she'd wonder where she'd ever heard his name before. 'Some one of these young men might have resented her acquaintance with Taylor. It's hard to say. I never heard of anything that might lead one to think some woman was jealous of his friendship for her.' Another report brought forward in motion picture circles here was that the director and Miss Normand had feared trouble of some sort and that they had made plans secretly to have a wedding to head it off... The report that Taylor had been engaged to Mary Miles Minter was scouted by her friends here. For one thing, it was pointed out that her recent reported engagement to Thomas E. Dixon, son of a pencil manufacturer, seemed much more substantial than any of the romantic affairs in which Miss Minter has been mentioned, and that this engagement was denied emphatically by both the youthful star and her mother, Mrs. Shelby.
1922-02-04	[Charles] Maigne left the central police station after being in consultation for more than an hour with Captain of Detectives J. L. Moffatt. He declined to state what had been discussed, but declared he believed Sands, the butler, could give valuable information in the case. Maigne is a close friend of Mabel Normand, and was with her yesterday when she received newspaper men who sought her story of her call at Taylor's home Wednesday evening.
1922-02-04	Police are also seeking a man, said to be a New York broker, the friend of a movie actress, whose name they will not reveal. He came here from the East, they say, shortly after the actress came. ...The figure of Miss Claire Windsor, moving picture actress, was rudely thrust into the mystery yesterday. A week ago Wednesday night Mr. Taylor and a prominent moving picture star called at the home of Miss Windsor's mother, Mrs. G. E. Cronk, and asked to take Claire to a party at the Ambassador Hotel. Claire went. It is declared that Taylor some few days later took Miss Windsor to another party and that nothing was heard of her again until yesterday morning, some hours after Taylor was found cold and stiff in his luxurious apartment, a bullet hole in his body. Miss Windsor could not be found today. Her mother said she was 'out on location' with Marshall Neilan, a director. At the office of the director this was denied. Neilan, it was said, was on location, but not Miss Windsor. Just what connection there may be between the murder and Miss Windsor's unexplained disappearance, if there be any connection, could not be learned. Mrs. Cronk could give no explanation. 'My daughter knew Mr. Taylor,' said Mrs. Cronk tonight. 'But the first time she ever went out with him was a week ago Wednesday night. 'Mr. Taylor came with an actor whom I do not know. I thought nothing of it, for a long time ago Mr. Taylor was her director, and, besides, Claire goes out to dinner parties and dances nearly every night. The ways of the movies are queer and not for me to ask questions about. 'I had not seen Claire since Sunday--not until this morning--but I thought nothing of that either. You see, she has a little boy three years old and he disturbs her when she sleeps at home. So she had a couch put in at her studio and she sleeps there in peace and no baby crying to wake her up. 'When she didn't come back, I wasn't particularly worried. I thought she was at the studio. She got home this morning and said to me, 'Isn't it too bad. Mr. Taylor has been murdered. Such a nice man.' Then she left to go out somewhere on location.' There has been no effort on the part of the police as yet to get in touch with Miss Windsor; but every effort is being made to learn everything possible about Taylor, his life, his friends and his enemies. All Hollywood is being raked; all the queer meeting places of the movie actors and actresses, directors and assistant directors, cameramen and extras--restaurants, beauty parlors, dens where opium and marihuana and other strange drugs are common, dens where men and women dress in silk kimonos and sit in circles and drink odd drinks--are being visited. Everyone who has come into contact with the slain director, no matter how remotely, is being questioned. Things that may shock the world of moving picture fans, are destined to come out of the mystery, it is said. Peculiar stars, male and female, may be scorched and smirched before the police investigation is over. And all the sins of the cinema colony will be made known. Dope fiends will figure in the tale before it is all told and strange effeminate men and peculiarly masculine women. The police are working now on two theories. One is that a beautiful woman is in back of the affair, someone of the hundreds of beautiful women of the studio world. Perhaps she was a woman scorned, or the sweetheart of another man, perhaps--but there are many motives and the police have not yet decided on any. The other theory is that an enemy made in that mysterious part of the dead man's life, which he so well kept from his friends in Hollywood, was the murderer. It is almost certain that a man committed the murder. A man was seen before and after the shot was heard, according to Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean, who live in the same court of apartments, and the other witnesses. And the shot that ended Taylor's life came from a .38 weapon, a gun deemed too big for a woman to carry. The man is presumed to have entered the Taylor apartment while Taylor was escorting Mabel Normand to her automobile, bidding her goodby. The shot came a few minutes after Taylor re-entered the house. There was no attempt at robbery. Taylor's pockets had not been emptied. His jewels had not been touched. Not a drawer in the four rooms had been opened. If the intruder had meant to rob, he shot too quickly and became frightened and fled. Yet, according to the MacLeans, the man who came out of the front door of the Taylor apartment just after the shot--a tall man, roughly dressed, with cap pulled down on his head and a muffler around his neck--showed no signs of fright. He stood in the doorway and looked back, then departed--in such a way that no suspicion was aroused in the minds of those who saw him. A thief fleeing in terror after a murder would not act that way, the police assert. There are too many strange incidents connected with the affair also, the police say, to admit of the theory that a bungling burglar fired the shot. There have been many mysterious telephone calls, according to the negro man servant and cook, Harry [sic] Peavey. The phone would ring and no one would answer. Was it someone who merely wished to be satisfied that Taylor was at home?... The detectives are still searching for Edward F. Sands, Taylor's former secretary, who is said to have departed from the household some time ago while Taylor was abroad, taking with him numerous trinkets, also the Taylor motor and some forged checks. A peculiar thing in the minds of the police is that both Sands and Peavey are of a queer type, affected, given to feminine ways. Peavey was placed under arrest a few days ago and serious charges were made against him... Taylor, fifty years old, supposed to be a bachelor, lived in a cozy four- room apartment with his man servant, Harry [sic] Peavey, a queer chap, with a high, squeaky voice, a man arrested a few days ago charged with a serious offense. Peavey was proud of his cooking; he made the finest rice pudding to be had in Hollywood. And he liked to crochet doilies and scarfs and things. Taylor lived alone with his books and his pictures and with Peavey. Howard Fellows, a likable young chap, drove the big automobile. ...He loved jewelry, had lots of it. Perhaps the chain diamond ring, valued at $2,500 is best known to his friends. There was perhaps $20,000 worth of jewels in the apartment when Taylor was killed. His friends described him as witty, the girls say he loved to tease them. Recently, say his friends, he had been visiting the queer places in Los Angeles, where guests are served with marihuana and opium and morphine, where the drugs are wheeled in on tea carts, and strange things happen. 'It is not odd,' they say, 'he was looking for color.'
1922-02-04	While some of the most prominent members of the cinema colony in Los Angeles shuddered in horror as the grim details of the slaying of William D. Taylor, well-known film director, were told from the witness chair at the coroner's inquest today, what was characterized as the most important development since investigation of the slaying began was brought to light. That was the story of the bullet with which the motion-picture director was slain--a bullet that showed by its markings it had been manufactured years ago. As Detective Sergeant Herman Cline told of finding the peculiar shell and its probable significance in the ultimate unraveling of the mystery, listeners in the quiet hall outside the crowded inquest room could hear the subdued sobs of Mabel Normand, friend of the slain man, one of the last persons to see him alive, and herself one of the most noted figures in filmdom. Miss Normand was called as a witness and the inquest was delayed for some minutes until she arrived. Until the time for her appearance on the witness stand she was closeted in a small room adjoining the inquest chamber, where from time to time she gave way to her grief. ...Those who were summoned and who were ready to testify after the jury had been sworn in by the coroner were: Jesse L. Lasky, vice president of the Famous Players-Lasky organization, by whom Taylor was employed as director general. Charles Eyton, general manager of the West Coast Studios of that corporation. Miss Mabel Normand, noted film star, who so far as the police know was the last person to see Taylor alive. Douglas MacLean, another film star, whose home adjoins that of Taylor. Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of the star. Detective Sergeants Wallis, Ziegler, Herman Cline, Winn, Murphy, Cato and Cahill. Henry Peavey of 127 1/2 East Third street, negro servant of Taylor, who found the body of the slain man. Harry Fellows, chauffeur [sic] for Taylor. William Davis, chauffeur for Miss Normand. Verne Dumas, wealthy oil man, who was one of the first neighbors to enter the house. E. C. Jesserund [sic], owner of the apartment occupied by Mr. Taylor. ...Charles Eyton, general manager of the Lasky coast organization was called as the first witness. He was questioned by Coroner Nance: Q. Mr. Eyton, have you viewed the remains? A. Yes. Q. And you have identified the body? A. Yes, sir. It is William Desmond Taylor. Q. How old was Taylor at the time of his death and was he married? A. He was 45. Yes he had been married. Q. When did Mr. Taylor die? A. Thursday, or perhaps some time on Wednesday evening. I did not see the body until Thursday morning. Q. Please tell what you know of the situation. A. I was called Thursday morning by Harry Fellows, assistant to Mr. Taylor, who said that he had died suddenly as the result of a hemorrhage. I immediately went to the house where I found a deputy coroner and several other persons. The deputy declared death was due to an internal hemorrhage, and after reaching his hand under Taylor's vest, and finding a little blood, he stated that he believed it had run down from his mouth. I was not satisfied, however, that such was the case, and I called Harry Fellows. We then turned Mr. Taylor over onto his face, and pulling up his shirt, discovered the bullet wound. Q. Did you speak to any one about Mr. Taylor's residence as to whether or not a shot had been heard during the evening previous? A. Yes, I talked with Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean. Q. Did they fix any definite time that they believed they heard the shot. A. Mr. MacLean said it was about 8 or 8:15 o'clock. Mrs. MacLean thought it was a little later. Questioned by a juror Mr. Eyton answered as follows: Q. Was there any evidence of a struggle in the room? A. Not as far as I could see. Dr. A. S. Wagner, county autopsy surgeon was the next witness. Q. Did you perform an autopsy on William D. Taylor? A. Yes. Upon examination of the body of Mr. Taylor I found a bullet wound in the left side about 6 1/2 inches below the arm. The bullet passed through the left lung, and came out through the chest and over the right lung, lodging in the neck 4 1/2 inches to the left of the right shoulder. Q. What was the cause of Mr. Taylor's death? A. A gunshot wound in the chest caused his death. Mabel Normand, film star, was the next witness. She was not in the court when called, and was compelled to make her way through the crowd. The coroner told her to take a seat. She was plainly nervous, but not excited. Q. What is your name? A. Mabel Normand. Q. What is your occupation? A. Motion pictures. Q. Were you acquainted with William D. Taylor, the deceased? A. Yes. Q. Were you a visitor at his home last Wednesday evening? A. Yes. I arrived at his home at 7 p.m. Q. Did you leave Mr. Taylor alone in his room? A. No, he came with me out to the car. He stood and talked with me and told me he would call me at my home later in the evening. When I drove away I waved my hand at him and then he went back to his apartment. Q. Do you know when Henry Peavey, Mr. Taylor's valet, left the apartments? A. I don't know just exactly the time, but he left before I did. Q. Then Mr. Taylor told you that he would call you later, and did he ever call you? A. No; he never called me. When I told him 'good-by' at the car it was the last time I ever saw him alive. Henry Peavey, Taylor's valet was called to the stand. He told Coroner Nance that his occupation is that of cook and valet, and that he had been employed by Taylor for a period of six months. He said he was in the Taylor apartments on the evening of the tragedy. Q. When did you leave Mr. Taylor's home that evening? A. About 7:15 p.m. Q. Was there anyone else in the house besides yourself at the time you left? A. Miss Normand. That was all. Miss Normand came to the house to talk with Mr. Taylor about a book. It was a red-backed book, and they were discussing it when I left. They were both seated in the living-room not far from the front door. I had locked the back door and was leaving by the front door, and that's how I know where they were sitting. I always went out the front door when I went home in the evening. Q. When did you see Mr. Taylor again? A. The next morning about 7:30 o'clock. Q. What was Mr. Taylor doing when you next saw him? A. He was lying on the floor in the living-room flat on his back, a dead man. When I entered the door I first saw his feet. I didn't know what to think of his position on the floor and I spoke to him. I spoke to him two or three times, and then suddenly I saw blood on his face and on the floor, and then turned and ran out of the house, yelling at the top of my voice. Mr. Coroner, I was pretty badly scared, and I did not know what I was saying. Following a series of questions Peavey testified that Mr. Taylor was wearing the same clothing he had worn the evening before. He said that none of Mr. Taylor's jewelry had been disturbed. He also said the lights were burning just as they were the previous evening. The next witness was T. H. Ziegler. He stated he was a police officer and he had been called to the Taylor home that morning to investigate the shooting. Mr. Ziegler said: 'I found Mr. Taylor just inside the door of his apartments lying on his back, rigid and dead. Much blood had been flowing from his mouth, and it covered the back of his head and a portion of the floor near by. Q. Did you discover any evidence of violence? A. None whatever. Q. Did you find any weapons in the room? A. Not in that room. I went upstairs and found a 32-caliber automatic revolver in another room. It had five loaded shells in it, and had not been fired for days, perhaps weeks.
1922-02-04	Less than three hours before he was slain William Desmond Taylor, motion picture director, was mulling through volumes of poetry on the shelves of C. C. Parker's book store, 520 West Sixth street. Veiling an aesthete's enthusiasm behind a kindly reserve Taylor glanced casually through his beloved books and finally turned to Miss Mae Irons, saleslady. 'He purchased 'The Home Book of Verse' in two volumes,' Miss Irons said today. 'The work is a modern anthology of English verse. He paid $25 for it.' It was only a few minutes before 5 o'clock when Taylor left the Parker store. 'He seemed in normal spirits,' Miss Irons said. 'He was a very courteous gentleman. I did not know who he was until Mr. Parker told me afterward.' According to Miss Irons, Taylor said he was buying the anthology so that he might give one of the volumes to a friend. He had previously given the books to this friend, he explained, and one of them had been lost. Taylor introduced himself to Parker before leaving the store. 'I know you well by reputation,' Parker said to him jovially, 'but those of us who know, don't count much on reputation.' Taylor's answer was an amused smile. It is believed the motion picture director went almost immediately home from the book store...
1922-02-04	The latest 'release' from Los Angeles cinema colony is that of a thriller that promises to run through more than one reel. It is the tale of a murder, sordid, perhaps, in its intimate details, yet possessed of the one attribute dear to the producer's heart, that of mystery. How or in what manner it will end is just now beside the case. That wonderful community of abnormal personalities will continue to hold a fair place on the front page for some time yet because of this unpretty contribution to the record its habitues have made. Will H. Hays will find in it at least one of the minor problems he will have to deal with, although it is conceivable that the regulation of the private lives of the actors who disport before the camera is not included in the business management of the great industry. Unfortunate though it be, the assembling in more or less forced intimacy of considerable numbers of persons of both sexes whose code of personal behavior is not the rigid sort that pervades the general walk of life, is likely to produce results that shock the world by their nature. Nothing shown on the screen has so far exceeded in weirdness the things actually done by the movie players. Men and women in other walks of life have suffered by similar tragedies, but it is the movie stars' misfortune in such cases that millions of people had interest in them. Their every act almost, even those of personal conduct, are on a public stage.
1922-02-04	POLICE SEEK BUTLER IN TAYLOR MURDER Authorities Are informed He Threatened to Kill Film Director After Theft Charges. WAS SEEN IN LOS ANGELES Dead Man 's Daughter is Sought Here-War Veterans Plan a Military Funeral. Special to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 3. The first direct evidence connecting a suspect with the murder of William Desmond Taylor, moving picture director, was unearthed today, when the police were informed by one person that Edward. P. Sands, formerly employed by the dead man as a butler and accused by him of theft, had on the day before the murder threatened to kill Taylor. Two other persons informed the police that they had seen Sands in Los Angeles on the day before the murder. The police tonight were conducting a wide search for Sands, and they believe that his arrest would go a long way toward solving the mystery of Taylor 's death. The names of two young film actresses and another man who had not previously figured in the case also were linked with the investigation by the police, Subpoenas for more than half a score of film actors and actresses and men prominent in the motion picture industry were serveds by police detectives today for the inquest at 10:30 tomorrow morning over the body of Taylor. Among those who will testify will be Mary Miles Minter, Douglas MacLean, Mabel Normand, Edna Purviance, Charles Eyton, Mrs. Douglas MacLean and Mrs. Julius Crawford Ivers, Howard Fellows, a chauffeur employed by Taylor, and Henry Peavey, a negro servant in the Taylor home, were questioned by the police today. As a result of the inquiry the police say they definitely fixed the time of the murder at about 8 o'clock Wednesday evening. According to Fellows, he appeared at the Taylor home at 7:45 o'clock and rapped at the front door to summon his employer. The lights were burning, he said, but there was no response to his summons. Fifteen minutes later, he said, he tried to get Taylor by telephone, but without success. Peavey's story was the same as that he told after the body of Taylor was found. Home Is Searched. The police made a thorough search of Mr. Taylor's home today and took charge of letters, papers and documents that might serve to throw some light on the slain man 's affairs. They drew plans of each room and the territory about the residence, The arrangement of the furniture in the room where Taylor was shot was not disturbed, as the police declared that a careful scrutiny would be made for possible finger prints. Mr. Taylor's apartments were tastefully furnished. There were books in profusion, mostly of a philosophical and soclalistic nature," Taylor's funeral will not be held until next week. This was the decision reached today by his closest friends. A committee was appointed by the Directors' Association to plan for the funeral services, in which many motion picture stars will participate. Frank Lloyd, director for Norma Talmadge and one of Mr. Taylor 's closest Friends, stated that final arrangements would not be announced until investigators in New York had located the slain man's daughter, Ethel Daisy Taylor, who is said to be a pupil in a private school on Long Island. The Overseas Club, comprised of veterans of the British armies, is arranging to participate in the funeral services. Mr. Taylor was a soldier in the Canadian Army during the war and was retired as a Captain. Dr. H. M. S. Maddock of the Overseas Club declared that an escort of Canadian Army officers, a firing squad of Canadian ex-service men and a Scottish band to play the funeral dirge on the bagpipes will be furnished by the club. Lloyd stated that he would probably get a British military burial. A petition for probate of the estate of Mr. Taylor was filed today by Public Administrator Bryson. The petition stated that the estate is valued at approximately $60,000, but as various papers have not yet been found the exact  value is unknown. Listed in the petition are $6,000 in the bank, $4,500 in Government bonds, $5,000 in automobiles, jewels valued at $1,500 and incidentals about the house of an approximate value of $1,500. The heirs are unknown, the petition stated. A committee of investigation was organized today by the directing heads of the combined motion picture corporations to assist in solving the mystery surrounding the murder. The committee was formed following a meeting of the Motion Picture Directors' Association, of which Mr. Taylor was the head. Major Maurice Campbell, a member of the Famous Players-Lasky staff of directors, and a personal friend of the slain man, was named Chairman of the committee. The investigators, who have conferred with Captain of Detectives David Adams, are mostly former army officers who were personally acquainted with Mr. Taylor. Today the investigators were engaged in reviewing Mr. Taylor's career to determine if he had any personal enemies. They have also begun a canvass of all the studios to find any persons who may be of some assistance in their investigation. While the revenge and jealousy theories appear to be the most plausible, the police are not overlooking the possibility of blackmail. It is considered possible that the slayer attempted to extort money from Mr. Taylor and when refused and threatened with arrest he shot to kill. An open check book on Mr. Taylor's writing desk and a pen with fresh ink on it, might be deduced as part of a ruse by Mr. Taylor to "stall the murderer off" until he could advise the authorities. The theory that a woman is involved in the slaying is being seriously entertained by police. Although the slain man led a studious life, it is known that he had a wide circle of acquaintances and that many of them were frequent visitors to his home. It is said that Taylor's first wife lives in Mamaroneck, L.I., with her daughter, Ethel Daisy Taylor. It is thought that she still used the name Taylor, though this is not certain.
1922-02-04	LAYS TAYLOR'S DEATH TO UNKNOWN SLAYER. INQUEST IN LOS ANGELES ENDS. Inquest in Los Angeles Ends Abruptly Without Hearing All the Film Stars Summoned. Special to the New York Times. LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 4 - Ending with dramatic suddenness after a few witnesses had been examined, and with detectives rushing from the scene in an automobile on a mysterious clew, the inquest over the body of William Desmond Taylor, film director, who was murdered in his home on Wednesday night, today added new sensations to the murder case. The developments at the proceedings were: Henry Peavey, Taylor's negro servant, collapsed when taken into the Morgue to view the body just before the inquest started. He was revived, called to the witness stand, and there became hysterical, laughing loudly when asked what he did upon finding the dead body of his employer. Coroner Vance suddenly halted the inquest after calling but one of the motion picture actresses summoned, Mabel Normand, and several of the jury then retired and returned a verdict that Taylor was killed "by a gunshot wound inflicted by a person or persons unknown to this jury, with intent to kill or murder." Captain of Detectives David Adams reached the scene just as the last witness was excused. He summoned Detective Sergeant Herman Cline and other police officers present and they droe away in an automobile, going west on Tenth Street. A vast crowd of curious persons was attracted by the inquest, the first formal hearing in the case: many who were unable to gain entrance stood in the street to get a glimpse of actors, actresses, and others who actively participated in the proceedings. There was a hush of expectation when Coroner Nance called Miss Mabel Normand as a witness. She appeared calm as she walked to the witness chair and formally gave her name. "I saw Mr. Taylor at his home on Wednesday evening," Miss Normand stated. "I called at 7 o'clock that evening and left at about 7:45 o'clock. Mr. Taylor escorted me to my automobile at the curb and we chatted a moment. After the car started away and as it was turning around I turned and waved my hand to him. He was standing on the sidewalk." Miss Normand was asked who was present at the Taylor house during the Taylor house on Thursday. was the final visit. She replied that the only other person there besides herself and the slain man was Henry Peavey, the colored servant. "He left the house fifteen or twenty minutes before I did," Miss Normand said. The witness said that Mr. Taylor had promised to telephone her at home later that evening. She added that she went home and retired and did not again hear from Mr. Taylor. Charles Eyton, general manager of the Lasky studios, where Taylor had been emplyed as chief director, was the first witness. He testified that Taylor was 45 years old and had once been married. The Coroner questioned the witness briefly concerning the career of the slain man. The second witness was Dr. A. F. Wagner county autopsy surgeon. He testified that the bullet entered Taylor's body at the left side, penetrating between the lobes of the left lung and lodging in the neck. Tom Ziegier, Detective Sergeant, who was the first official to reach the Tayylor, witness. He explained how he made the preliminary investigation, explaining that when he first arrived it was believed Taylor had died of a hemorrhage. The only weapon found in the house was Taylor 's revolver, Ziegler said. It was in a dresser drawer in the bedroom and was a  .32-calibre automatic gun. As Ziegler stepped from the stand Coroner Nance remarked "That is all," and the inquest abruptly ended. Many of the spectators, anticipating the questioning of others prominent in motion picture circles, appeared to be dazed by the abrupt termination of the proceedings. 
1922-02-05	...Taylor appeared in Telluride when apparently at the end of one of the low ebbs of his financial endeavors. He acted as night clerk for the New Sheridan Hotel there from June 10, 1910, until December 15, of the same year.
1922-02-05	William Desmond Taylor, the slain movie director, was well known in this city in 1908. But he was not known as Taylor. He was William Cunningham Deane-Tanner, expert in antiques in those days, and he moved in good society, was well supplied with money from a mysterious source in Ireland and eventually was married to Ethel May Harrison of one of the Floradora Sextettes. Without a word of explanation, according to the woman who was then his wife, he disappeared in 1908. The first Mrs. Deane-Tanner now is the wife of E. L. C. Robins, owner of Robins Restaurant and other hostelries. Mrs. Robins gave out a statement yesterday explaining her marriage and the desertion and her subsequent discovery that her former husband had popped up in the motion picture colony at Hollywood, Cal., and became famous the world over as William Desmond Taylor. She says his murder shocked her and the daughter he abandoned. 'I married, in December, 1901, Mr. William Cunningham Deane-Tanner of Dublin, Ireland,' the statement said. 'He disappeared in October, 1908. We could assign no reason for his disappearance except possibly aphasia. 'In 1912 I got a decree of divorce in the State of New York and was awarded the custody of my only child, Ethel Daisy Deane-Tanner, now 19. 'In August, 1914, I married Edward L. C. Robins. Two and a half weeks later I discovered that William Desmond Taylor had been Mr. Deane-Tanner. I have no further statement which possibly could be of interest. 'The news of Mr. Deane-Tanner's death was a great shock to my daughter and me.' At her home in Orienta Point, Mamaroneck, last night, Mrs. Robins said she held no resentment for the way Deane-Tanner treated her. She presented excuses for him, saying he suffered lapses of memory during the time they lived together and that not long before he vanished, in 1908, he was stricken with facial neuralgia and frequently was in an agony of pain. She does not believe he knew what he was doing the morning he left their home and she supposes that a mental ailment can be held to account for his failure to return. Just as dramatic as were many of the chapters in Deane-Tanner, or William Desmond Taylor's, life was Mrs. Robins's discovery in 1919 that he was still living. With her daughter Mrs. Robins went to a motion picture theater in this city one night. They chose the theater without knowing what picture it was featuring. For several hundred feet of film it was just a new picture as far as they were concerned, but suddenly the hero appeared. Mrs. Robins sank back in her seat too startled to speak. He daughter stood up. For the laughing face on the screen was that of the long missing Deane- Tanner a little changed--somewhat older looking they decided when they finally settled back to wait for the hero's next entry. They sat through the picture and then saw it again and learned that the man whose face they knew was acting and directing movies under the name of William Desmond Taylor. Mrs. Robins said last night that her daughter would not be satisfied until she had written to Taylor. Taylor answered her letter and the two continued a correspondence which grew with each month until finally Taylor of the movies came back to New York to try to make some amends for his conduct as Deane-Tanner, the negligent father. Taylor never explained why he had changed his name. But Mrs. Robins said he met her and the daughter on at least one occasion and expressed a desire to try to make good for his failure. He spent money lavishly on the girl, giving money and other presents to her and encouraging her to study. The love of the beautiful in art that appears to have impressed his Hollywood friends cropped up in his talks with his daughter, and he ultimately prevailed upon her to enter an art school in this city. She is now studying there. Mrs. Robins emphatically denied that her former husband ever married after he deserted her. She said she met him last August and remembers distinctly that he said he never had remarried and never would. His daughter, she quoted him as saying, was the only pal he wanted. According to Mrs. Robins, Deane-Tanner was of a family well known in Ireland--listed among the landed gentry or the peers, she wasn't sure which. His father was a Major in the British army, and he came of a line of men whose names have figured in British history. She said he was prepared for the army at one of the great British universities--Oxford or Cambridge--and that he was about to start for the military school when his health failed. He was sent to the United States, he told her, so that he might recover. Mrs. Robins said she remembers that he told her once he had two sisters and one brother, and she met soon after their marriage a man she supposes was the brother. The stories of drugs and drinking, Mrs. Robins thinks, are untrue, because while Deane-Tanner was her husband he used liquor but sparingly and always criticized those who did not know how to handle it. Before her marriage to Taylor--or Deane-Tanner, as he called himself then--Mrs. Robins was Miss Ethel May Harrison. No one could be found who could explain fully Deane-Tanner's early movements in New York, but it was established that he came from Ireland with considerable money and a habit of spending it freely. He caused some attention in sporting circles, talked about his yachts abroad, and eventually, it was said, became a familiar figure on the float of the Larchmont Yacht Club. He made friends easily and held them. Suddenly he began talking of previous visits here, and it was said yesterday, by men who knew him but do not want their names coupled with his in the murder mystery, that he let it be known he had played in roles opposite Fanny Davenport. Mrs. Robins would not say where she and her first husband made their home or where they were living when he disappeared, but it was established through friends that he dropped out of sight in 1908 a few weeks after the Vanderbilt cup races.
1922-02-05	The assassination of William Desmond Taylor, Wednesday night, postponed forever an engagement which the film director had with Antonio Moreno, film star, on Thursday morning. When Moreno talked with Taylor over the telephone Wednesday night, about 7 o'clock, Taylor was in the best of spirits, according to Moreno's story told yesterday. But when the time came for the appointment to be fulfilled the following morning, between 10 and 10:30 o'clock, the film director's corpse lay in a local undertaking company's morgue, pierced by a murderer's bullet. Moreno said yesterday that he had been an intimate friend of Taylor for several years, since the time Taylor had become associated with the old Vitagraph Company at Santa Monica in 1914. 'He was one of the finest men I ever met,' 'Tony' said. 'He had the highest ideals, I believe, of any man I've ever met in the profession.' Details of a dinner party which he attended with Taylor, Miss Betty Francisco and Miss Claire Windsor, at the Ambassador Hotel Thursday night, January 27, were given by Moreno, as well as an informal meeting held between Moreno, Taylor, Arthur Hoyt and a Captain Robinson [sic], January 28, at Moreno's room at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. 'I left them there about 7 o'clock,' Moreno said, 'to go to a dinner party at the Ambassador, which I had arranged for a friend visiting here from Chicago. Later, I understand, the three went to dinner at a roadhouse between Los Angeles and Pasadena--I do not know its name--and then on to the Annandale Club after dinner, finally going to Taylor's home.' Moreno declared he had spent about two hours last Monday with Taylor at the Vitagraph studio, where Moreno is working. He had an appointment with him for Tuesday, also, but the director, according to Moreno, did not fill it because of a trip to Mount Lowe on location. 'Then I called him again Wednesday night,' Moreno said, 'about 6 o'clock. His boy, Henry, answered the phone. Mr. Taylor was not at home. However, he called me later, about 7, and we arranged that I should call for Mr. Taylor, at the Lasky studio, about 10 o'clock Thursday morning. Mr. Hoyt was with me in my room at the time. Mr. Taylor was to go with me to the Vitagraph studio, on a matter of personal business.' 'But--' and here Moreno gave a sorrowful shake of his head--'But you know the rest. The appointment was not fulfilled--and never will be. 'I feel that in Mr. Taylor's death I've lost one of the best friends I've ever know. And I'll do everything in my power to run down the man who killed him.'
1922-02-05	William D. Taylor appeared to be in the best of health and spirits about one hour before he was shot down in his own apartment at 404-B South Alvarado Street. He did not appear to have any premonition of what lay in store for him, although, according to the police theory of the slaying of the film director, the murderer was then lurking in the shadows a few feet away from Mr. Taylor. This was disclosed yesterday by Tony Moreno, Vitagraph star. Mr. Moreno's story of his conversations with the slain director on the night of the murder and for a week prior to the shooting, furnish an important check on Mr. Taylor's movement for at least seven days preceding the shooting. 'I played golf with Mr. Taylor exactly a week before his death. We drove to the San Gabriel Country Club and remained there from about noon till dark. While there I introduced him to Asa Keyes, the Deputy District Attorney.' Mr. Moreno said yesterday at his apartment, in the Los Angeles Athletic Club. 'The next day I saw him again. I met him at the Ambassador at a party. Mr. Taylor was with Miss Claire Windsor. I saw him leave the hotel with her. There were a number of picture people there that night. 'Saturday night--that is, a week ago tonight--Mr. Taylor was here in the club. He was in my room and with us were Arthur Hoyt and Capt. Robertson, who is a close friend of Mr. Taylor. We sat and talked a while. Then Mr. Taylor, Mr. Hoyt and Capt. Robertson left. Later I learned they drove to Cedar Grove, near Pasadena, and had something to eat there. From there they drove to the Annandale Country Club. 'I saw Mr. Taylor next at the Lasky studios, Monday morning at 10 o'clock. I had an appointment with him to go to the Vitagraph studios, on a matter of business importance to me. Chester Bennett of the Brunton studios, was with us. We were together until 12:30 p.m. that day. 'We were unable to see the people we wanted that day. The appointment had to be made over again. I called Mr. Taylor again, Tuesday at the Lasky lot, but I did not get to talk to him. I was informed that he was out on location on Mt. Lowe. Tuesday, which was the day before the murder, I could not get in touch with him. 'Wednesday night Mr. Taylor called me at the club. I was in Mr. Hoyt's room, when the call came. We discussed the business appointment I wanted Mr. Taylor to participate in. As near as I can now recall it, it was about 7 o'clock when Mr. Taylor called. He did not tell me much about his trip to Mt. Lowe. 'Mr. Hoyt was present at the conversation. It lasted several minutes. Mr. Taylor then made an appointment for Thursday morning, at 10 o'clock. He appeared to be in best of spirits. He was pleasant and cheerful. 'It was a few minutes after 7 that Mr. Taylor hung up. Then Mr. Hoyt and I went to the club dining-room and stayed there for dinner. 'Thursday morning, Mr. Hoyt called me and told me I would not be able to keep the appointment with Mr. Taylor because he was dead. He then told me what he read in the papers.' The investigators last night began to check up the facts supplied by Mr. Moreno in an effort to supply the missing links and thus account for every action and movement of the slain director. Mr. Moreno's story supplied much important data, the officers say.
1922-02-05	Out of the tangled lives of two brothers, deputy sheriffs last night were endeavoring to find the secret of the death of William D. Taylor. Both had been married; both were fathers; both had everything to hold them at home. But both mysteriously disappeared from their homes and their old haunts. One is dead, after a reappearance in a new land--the West--and died in the glory of a success in his chosen field. The other has never reappeared--unless in some way the other brother is connected with the murder of William D. Taylor. The amazing story of a double life, as told exclusively in the city additions of The Examiner yesterday from the lips of Mrs. Ada Deane-Tanner, sister-in-law of the dead man, was elaborated upon yesterday by her. Reports had reached officials here yesterday from the East and from San Francisco that Mrs. Deane-Tanner had not married Dennis, the brother, but had married William, the director, who was murdered here last Wednesday night. This Mrs. Deane-Tanner yesterday emphatically denied, in her modest Monrovia home, in East Lemon street, just around the corner from the home of Coroner Willis O. Nance. 'I can prove,' she said, 'that I am not the director's widow. I am his sister-in-law. I have a marriage license here somewhere which shows I married Dennis, not William. The records in New York City will show separate licenses on separate years for the marriages of Dennis and William. Dr. Pomeroy, the county health officer, by brother-in-law, knew Dennis, my husband, and can tell you he is not the man shown in photographs as the famous director.' This was her convincing story, told in a whisper from the couch, where she lay ill from the shock of the tragedy and the sudden forcing of her and her history into the glaring limelight. Mrs. Deane-Tanner admitted to The Examiner yesterday for the first time that she had divorced her husband in Los Angeles six years ago. The divorce, she said, was granted by Superior Judge Charles Monroe on the grounds of desertion and nonsupport. At the time of the divorce case, Mrs. Deane-Tanner said, she recited, in brief, the story of the mysteriously disappeared husband and as there was no contest the divorce was granted. At the time, however, no mention of the relationship between this unknown woman and the famous director was made and even her relationship to Mrs. Pomeroy was not known. In a large way, backing up and corroborating the story told by the old woman, was the story given to The Examiner by Dr. Pomeroy himself. 'I cannot say for sure,' stated the county official, 'that William Desmond Taylor was not Dennis Gage Deane-Tanner. 'But I can hardly believe that they were one and the same man. 'I've seen pictures of the murdered man, though to my knowledge I never saw him in the flesh, and this man is not the man I knew in New York as my relative by marriage.' Dr. Pomeroy admitted that he had naturally not seen Dennis Deane-Tanner since his disappearance in New York years ago, but he stated that he has a good recollection on his appearance and that he was unquestionably not William. 'I never saw the two brothers together,' he continued, 'and in fact, I never saw the elder brother, William. But there must have been two brothers, as Dennis frequently mentioned William. I met him several times in the East.' Dr. Pomeroy also corroborated his sister-in-law's story that she had employed detective agencies to search for her husband when he disappeared, but that no trace of the man had ever been found. The theory of certain officers that for the solution of the crime the investigators should go back to New York, 1912, instead of Los Angeles, 1922, met with little enthusiasm from Mrs. Deane-Tanner yesterday, although she admitted that in the mysterious past of the two brothers some common motive might be linked. 'I am more inclined to believe,' she said, 'that the solution of the crime lies in some quarrel or misunderstanding of recent origin--something growing out of the associations he has formed since coming to this Coast. Somehow I can't believe that the disappearance of my husband and William's disappearance had any connection, and though I wouldn't at all be surprised to learn that my former husband is still alive, I can't believe that he could possibly be connected with his brother's death in any way--even as a possible fellow victim.' The sister-in-law of the murdered man made light of a theory that some old English feud might have been behind the mystery in the lives of both brothers--some overwhelming tragedy which, if disclosed, would make trivial the astounding revelations so far before the public. Mrs. Deane-Tanner's elaborated story of her relationship in this maze of tangled lives is as follows: 'My maiden name was Ada C. Brennan. I was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. C. K. Brennan of New York. Both my parents are dead. 'I was married to Denis Gage Deane-Taylor [sic], a man considerably smaller than his brother, though of similar general appearance, in 1907 in New York. 'By that marriage I had two daughters, Muriel, now 14, and Alice, now 12 years old. 'In 1912 I had lung trouble and my husband sent me to the Adirondack Mountains for a rest cure. When I had been there a week I suddenly received a telegram from my mother in the metropolis to come home at once. I immediately took a train for the city and when I arrived I learned that my husband had disappeared. 'We hunted high and low for him. We employed detectives and did every manner of things possible to make likely his discovery, but in vain. To this day I have never heard from or heard of my husband. 'After futile waiting and wondering and heart-broken nights trying to live until the next hard day of raising two children, fatherless, I sued for divorce and was awarded a decree. 'During the time I was married I became very friendly with Mrs. Frederick Young of New York. She was the former wife of Edward Thaw, a half brother of Harry K. Thaw. 'I was also a good friend of Ethel Putnam, daughter of George H. Putnam, and her sister, Dorothy; one year on a tour of Europe stopped at Kent, England, to visit Mr. Deane-Tanner's family. Thus I learned something of William Deane-Tanner, though I met him personally but several times in my life. 'Both these sisters finally were married and I have lost track of them-- don't even know their names now. 'Finally, after futile searches for my husband, I and my children moved to Monrovia, to stay at the home of my sister, Mrs. Pomeroy, at 240 East Palm street, and after they moved, I came to this address. 'My husband, while with me in New York, worked for A. S. Vernay, 12 East Forty-Fifth street, as an interior decorator, and when he disappeared Mr. Vernay could find no business reason for his having done so. His books, as were his brothers books four years before on his disappearance, were perfect and his work had been most satisfactory, Mr. Vernay said. 'On November 28, 1915, here at Monrovia, I was notified that Mrs. Young, my friend, had died and had left to me a bequest which amounted to roughly $1000 a year for life. With other moneys I had, this annuity would have made it possible for me to have taken care of my children amply for life, but through litigation, on some technicality, I never was able to get my bequest. 'Mrs. Young died on November 6, 1915, and her estate was compared to be of some $1,000,000. We had always been good friends and she was most kind to me at all times. 'In the letter advising me of the bequest it was stated that as soon as the estate was settled I would receive the money quarterly.' Turning back to her brother-in-law, now dead, she went on: 'My first child, Muriel, was born in New York city in 1908, in November, and after her birth I met my brother-in-law for the first time. Denis' brother came up to see me and his little niece, but we talked only a short time. He was considerably larger than Denis, but similar to him in general appearance, as I have said. 'From then on I saw him only occasionally. 'His disappearance, the talk of the town at that time, however, I shall not easily forget. 'It was the day of the notable Vanderbilt Cup race on Long Island, in November, 1908. William had witnessed the race, and had been seen there by scores of his friends, as he was popular. 'The next day the earth had swallowed him. He was gone, had disappeared and it was several years before he was heard from again, and then only indirectly. 'His wife, the former Ethel Hamilton, Floradora girl, was devoted to him and they had but few quarrels, but her grief was no greater than my husband's at his brother's loss. 'He was inconsolable and for months though of nothing else. If he had any suspicion of how and why his brother had gone he never whispered a word of it to me and I never for a moment thought, or think now, that he knew. 'That there was anything in their mutual past that could have caused this tragedy I cannot believe. 'Of course, William's relations with his wife, which I have referred to, I knew only by gossip, but naturally took it at the time at its face value.' Before her death, Mrs. Young made a trip to California and while here learned that William Deane-Tanner, known as William D. Taylor, was at work in motion pictures and 'was doing well,' according to Mrs. Deane-Tanner's story. 'Petey' he was known then, and apparently when Mrs. Young communicated this information to the former show girl in New York, Taylor's wife, she was surprised to learn that the girl already knew of her husband's whereabouts and was not surprised to learn that Taylor was here in pictures under a new name. Nevertheless, it was a shock to the Deane-Tanner's friends there, because the young wife was not supposed to know anything of her husband's whereabouts. Mrs. Ada Deane-Tanner's attempts to interview Taylor, the director, on her arrival here, his denial of identity, and his finally sending her an allowance, though still denying that he was related to her, was told exclusively in yesterday's Examiner and this story was not changed in the least by the sister-in-law yesterday. His letter to her, telling her that he would send her the money, Mrs. Deane-Tanner said, she still had and would produce, with the marriage license only if forced to by the authorities, saying that she saw no reason for doing so. Mrs. Deane-Tanner in Monrovia yesterday was being advised by several men, one connected with a bank there and the other an attorney, but neither of these men would make a statement. Being ill, she was attended by a neighbor and her children were being taken care of elsewhere. Miss Kate Collins, principal of the Wild Rose school in Monrovia, where the two children attended, was high in her praise of the two kiddies. She said she remembered when the Deane-Tanners arrived there, because of their relationship to Mrs. Pomeroy, but had no knowledge until reading The Examiner yesterday of her relationship to the film director. Both Muriel and Alice, she said, were among the brightest in their classes, Muriel being in the eighth grade and Alice in the sixth. Both she described as always cheerful and anxious to help others, and Alice, she said, is of the 'smiley' type, always with a cheerful grin greeting her friends and teachers. One of the girls, Muriel, is said to have a marked resemblance to her murdered uncle, both Mrs. Deane-Tanner and one of her advisers said yesterday. Chief of Police E. A. Bovee of Monrovia, is taking an active interest in the case, giving the sheriff's office all help possible in his end.
1922-02-05	Missing letters and telegrams sent by Mabel Normand, celebrated film star, to William Desmond Taylor, the famous motion-picture director who was slain last Wednesday night within a few moments after Miss Normand left his home, formed the basis of a separate investigation hinging about the murder mystery last night. Captain of Detectives Adams and Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill last night questioned Mary Miles Minter, also a widely known screen actress, concerning her knowledge of the life of Mr. Taylor. The officers, after a long session with Miss Minter, declared they had uncovered no important new facts. Miss Normand made a personal visit to the home at 404-B South Alvarado street, where Mr. Taylor's body was found, a bullet in his back and she asked for her letters. She went to the top drawer of Mr. Taylor's dresser to get them. They were not there. Captain of Detective Adams told her he did not know where they were. Late last night he repeated the statement. With the officials seeking these letters Charles Eyton, general manager of the Famous Players-Lasky studio and who assumed charges of many of the dead man's personal effects, also stated he did not have them, according to police. The visit of Miss Normand, directly after the Coroner's inquest earlier in the day, was dramatic in many respects. She appeared at the Taylor apartment while Officers Cline, Cahill, Cato and Winn were there with Capt. Adams. Mabel Normand then re-enacted the scene that the officers believe took place shortly before the fatal shot was heard by neighbors within a few minutes after Miss Normand left. She arranged the furniture of the handsomely appointed apartment as it was on the last visit she paid to the director, who has filmed such stars as Mary Pickford, Mary Miles Minter, Betty Compson and others. She showed where the chair that was overturned on Mr. Taylor's legs when the body was found, was standing when she left the home about 7:45 p.m. last Wednesday. She again told of some of the conversation which she and Mr. Taylor had that night. And she showed how Mr. Taylor had escorted her from the court of the apartments to her automobile, in which her chauffeur was sitting... But during this visit, Miss Normand asked for her letters. She said she knew Mr. Taylor kept them in the top drawer of his dresser and there the search was directed in vain. Public Administrator Bryson could not be found all day yesterday but the officers declare that to the best of their knowledge he has not taken charge of the letters. Miss Normand last night said, 'I am surprised that anyone should have been interested in these letters of mine to Mr. Taylor. I am sure there is nothing in them of any interest to the general public. 'There is nothing in them that would help the police in any way. There were some of my letters in Mr. Taylor's room--I would say six or seven and several telegrams I had sent him while I was in New York. 'The letters, too, were those sent by me to Mr. Taylor, when he was in New York or when I was in New York. 'I knew they were in his dresser drawer because he showed them to me once when he showed me over the house immediately after he was robbed. 'On that occasion he happened to open the top drawer of his dresser and I saw the letters. 'I said, 'Why, you're not keeping those letters, are you?' and he made some pleasant remark, saying he was keeping them.' In addition to the mystery of Miss Normand's letters and the efforts of the officers to reconstruct as nearly as possible the scene before the crime investigators from the detective bureau, the District Attorney's office and the Sheriff's office worked well into the night unraveling some of the loose ends of the case. Mary Miles Minter, film luminary and close friend of Mr. Taylor, was reported early yesterday to be confined to her home because of illness. On the morning the murder was discovered she rushed to the Taylor home and became almost hysterical when she confirmed the news of his death. ...Placing the home of a widely known Hollywood man under surveillance late yesterday, officers were searching last night for this man, who is wanted as a material witness. Several new clews, one of which is declared to have placed this man's automobile in the vicinity of the Taylor flat at 404-B South Alvarado street about the time of the slaying, have been uncovered. This man is widely and somewhat unfavorably known among many film celebrities and his name has figured in previous police investigations. His mysterious visits at homes of several members of the film colony are being checked in connection with the new angle. Officers late in the day were watching his home. Vigorous efforts were being made to locate him for questioning. Meanwhile, other officers, particularly Detective Sergeants Yarrow and Mallheau, narcotic traffic experts, turned their attention to another new angle. They started yesterday afternoon to investigate several reports concerning 'dope' traffic in Hollywood and other supposed clews, which tend to indicate that visits of 'peddlers' of dope had been made in that vicinity. A report of a supposed threat made on the night of the murder also was being run down by the officers. This report, made by a downtown business man to the police, was expected to set the officers on the trail of a man who is quoted as saying on the night Mr. Taylor was slain within a few minutes after Mabel Normand, film star, left the Taylor home, 'There will be a movie director show up missing in the morning.' ...Capt. Adams yesterday stated it is not impossible that Mr. Taylor was killed by a burglar, who seized upon the opportunity provided when Mr. Taylor escorted Miss Normand to her automobile to sneak in the house. The position of the bullet and the line of fire indicated shows, Capt. Adams said, that the assassin probably was crouching behind the door when Mr. Taylor entered...
1922-02-05	There were no women's tears at the inquest yesterday which determined that William Desmond Taylor came to his death at the hands of an assassin. The only sobs were contributed by Henry Peavey, negro valet and cook, who wailed aloud when he entered the inquest rooms at the Ivy Overholtzer undertaking rooms, where Coroner Nance conducted the hearing. ...Sobs interfered somewhat with Peavey's testimony. He knelt on the floor by the bier first and sobbed aloud and his wails were frequent during the entire hearing...His mourning sounded so much like a guffaw that many smiled, but there were tears in Peavey's eyes...
1922-02-05	Denver, Feb. 4--William Desmond Taylor, Los Angeles motion-picture director, may have been murdered by mistake due to his resemblance to a man hated by some underworld avenger. This opinion was given today by Judge Ben B. Lindsey when he learned of Taylor's death at the hands of an assassin. Judge Lindsey said Mr. Taylor told him of having been held all night by Denver police who believed he was a man much wanted. Mr. Taylor said his protestations of innocence caused him to be severely beaten by police clubs. The following morning, after he had established his identity, profuse apologies were extended, but he never learned the name of the man for whom he was mistaken. 'Was he murdered for revenge by some crook whom his double had betrayed?' Judge Lindsey asked. 'He may have been the image of some underworld character.'
1922-02-05	The most unfeigned astonishment was expressed yesterday throughout the entire local filmdom over the disclosures made regarding the dual role played in life by William Desmond Taylor, noted film director, who was shot Wednesday night. Both surprise and regret were the feelings expressed in the Mary Miles Minter household. Mrs. Julia B. Miles, Miss Minter's grandmother, said: 'Somehow my faith in human beings is a little shaken this morning because of all people with a shadowy past I would never have suspected Mr. Taylor. In fact I asked him once if he were a bachelor or a widower and he said 'I am a confirmed bachelor,' and as I believed him to be the very essence of truth I naturally felt shocked to learn he had a wife and child. 'My granddaughter, Miss Minter, looked on him as a child might regard a father. She is 19 and he was 55 [sic], and she is an impulsive child and when she heard of his death the other morning she rushed over there and cried all over the place without a thought of having her name dragged into the affair. 'We all liked him and admired him because he was so kind, because he was such a thorough gentleman and such a profound scholar. He was a man of moods, however, sometimes becoming very depressed and gloomy, and one winter when he was directing a picture of Miss Minter's which was being filmed in Boston, he became so despondent that my grand-daughter nicknamed him 'Desperate-Desmond,' just in jest, you know. 'Miss Minter has only seen Mr. Taylor once in the last five months and I was with her at the time. We were driving up Broadway and Mr. Taylor passed us in his car and my grand-daughter said, 'Oh, Mr. Taylor has repainted his car,' and I said, 'Yes, I suppose that man who stole his things tore the car all to pieces. Mr. Taylor stopped and we passed a few friendly greetings with him, but we did not mention any of his troubles with the man who had robbed him, or touch on any of his personal affairs, for while our friendship with him was pleasant and cordial, it was by no means intimate.' Claire Windsor expressed surprise that her name had been connected in any way with that of the dead man. 'I had never been out but once in my life with Mr. Taylor, ' said Miss Windsor, 'and that time it was arranged without my knowledge. Mr. Moreno invited me to join a party of four at the Ambassador and Mr. Taylor was the escort he provided for me. He seemed an extremely reserved and diffident man, but very courteous and dignified, and I liked him.'
1922-02-05	...[telling of Henry Peavey on the witness stand at the inquest] 'What did you see?' 'I saw his feet, and I said 'Mr. Taylor'--just like that. Then I saw his face, and I turned and run out and yelled. And then I yelled some more--' And then Henry broke into high pitched laughter as he recalled his fright and terror. Laughed as he thought of himself going in and speaking to a dead man. It was a huge joke--no doubt about it. And the joke was on him. Of course, He laughed and those in the room laughed with him...
1922-02-05	Denver, Feb. 4--A clew uncovered her today suggests the possibility that the murder of William Desmond Tanner Taylor was a case of mistaken identity. Coupled with the statement of friends of Taylor that he was a genial soul, without a known enemy in the world, the theory that he was murdered by a person who though he was someone else becomes probable. This new angle on the case was furnished by Judge Ben B. Lindsey of the Juvenile Court, who became intimate with Taylor during the filming of 'The Soul of Youth,' a picture which Taylor directed and in which Judge Lindsey was featured. Lindsey said that Taylor had told him of his experiences in Denver ten years ago, when the famous director was a mining engineer working at Ouray. On one of his frequent visits to Denver, Taylor told Lindsey he had been mistaken for another man by a policeman and placed under arrest. When Taylor protested and affirmed that he was not the man in question, the policeman attacked him with his club and beat him severely. He was lodged in the city jail over night. Taylor's story continued, but in the morning was able to establish his identity and was released with profuse apologies. He never learned the name of the man he was mistaken for and was booked merely 'For investigation.' Was Taylor the walking image of some underworld character? Was he murdered for revenge by some crook whom his double had betrayed? Did he know his own double and was he slain by the man he looked like to prevent his informing the police of the caller's actions? These are questions which the authorities will have to solve in their investigations of the film director's mysterious murder. Judge Lindsey himself did not suggest the possibility of Taylor's being slain my mistake. He appeared quite perplexed about a motive for the crime, describing Taylor as one of the kindliest and most gentle men he had ever known. By a coincidence he was reading a letter from Louis Sargent, who played the leading juvenile role in 'The Soul of Youth' when he learned of the director's death. 'Don't you wish we could appear together again in one of Mr. Taylor's pictures?' wrote Louis. Scarcely a moment later Mrs. Lindsey entered the judge's room and informed him of Taylor's murder. 'William Desmond Taylor was one of the finest types of gentlemen I ever met,' said Judge Lindsey today. 'He was not the type of man one would connect with scandal in the movies. I don not believe that anything will develop from this tragedy to throw discredit upon his character. 'He was a scholarly man, patient, kindly, and gentle. Perhaps his quiet disposition may have developed the impression of his being a 'mystery man.' I do not believe there is any mystery to his discredit. 'It was in May, 1920, that I was with him almost daily while we were working together on a moving picture called 'The Soul of Youth,' in which I consented to do the part of a judge of a juvenile court. During this time I met him frequently at the studio and a number of times at the office. 'He was interested in the boy problem, as shown by his productions of 'Tom Sawyer,' 'Huckleberry Finn' and 'The Soul of Youth.' I watched his work at the studio with children, and I used to tell him he would make an excellent juvenile court judge because he had such marvelous patience and could get so much out of children. I suppose that is the reason he got so much out of the stars among the women whom he had successfully directed, including Mary Pickford, Mary Miles Minter, Elsie Ferguson and others. 'He had been the means of helping one little girl whom I once knew in this court and was always glad to acknowledge any of my letters about young people I knew in connection with the movies. 'The last I heard of him was about the first of the year, when he sent me a little Christmas and New Year message.'
1922-02-05	...Miss Minter was not at the inquest, which was held this morning; but she was represented by counsel. She had known the dead man well. She was hysterical when she learned of his death. 'It was terrible,' she said. 'I rushed at once to my mirror and looked at my face. I was appalled. I kept the expression and hurried to mamma. ''Mamma,' I cried, 'did you ever see this expression on my face before.' ''No,' she said; 'it is perfect. Frozen horror! You've never done it before.''...
1922-02-05	--Henry Peavey, negro, who described himself as 'Mr. Taylor's valet,' was a conspicuous figure at the inquest over the body of his former master here this morning. Dressed in a natty check suit, Peavey arrived early and was the center of several groups of curiosity seekers. Just before the inquest began he asked permission to see the body. He was led to the room where the body of the famous film director lay. Peavey approached the body and then broke down. He cried for more than a minute. Then he walked around the corpse several times. 'He looks just like he did many times when I would go to wake him up in the morning to give him his medicine--just so natural,' he said, tears streaming down his face. A few minutes later Peavey took his seat in the inquest room, having mastered his emotions.
1922-02-05	...Late last night Detective Captain Adams, after a three hour conference with Mary Miles Minter, issued an official statement in which he said, 'Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill, together with myself, interviewed Miss Minter. We talked with her several hours regarding her relations with Taylor. We are absolutely satisfied that Miss Minter knows nothing that will throw any light at all on this mystery nor do we believe that she is even remotely connected with the case.' It was rumored late last night that Edward F. Sands, discharged secretary of William Desmond Taylor, who has been sought as a material witness in the slaying of Taylor, had been found, questioned and placed in secret custody... Another man was being looked for last night in the person of a man whose reputation has been none too savory. While there is no direct evidence implicating him, he is one of those persons coming within that classification so frequently described in blunt police comment, 'I wouldn't put it past him.' Possible suspicion would not have turned in his direction but it had been noted by some of this fellow's acquaintances that he had not been seen in his familiar haunts since the murder. He is described as a man much easier to find than to lose and the picture colony has been whispering about him. George Contreras of the district attorney's investigating staff, and Deputy Sheriffs Fox, Nolan and Bell, who yesterday entered the case, were in a search for this man last night. If he is not the actual murderer they expect him to tell a story which will materially advance the investigation. An earlier development of the day, however, struck the picture colony with more amazement that this feature. It was the report that one of the big figures of the screen, a man whose sudden rise to fame has been one of the marvels of the profession, was under suspicion. His name was first linked with the crime as a possibility to be considered because he had been paying marked attention to an actress who is known to have been one of Taylor's most intimate friends. Then came the reminder that the man in question answers the physical characteristics of the assassin whom Mrs. Douglas MacLean saw leaving Taylor's apartment shortly after a shot had been heard. It was further recalled that this man often wore a dark silk scarf, such as that figuring in Mrs. MacLean's description, and also a cap. However, it was learned last night that this man had voluntarily offered to account for every minute of his time on Wednesday night. It is stated in this connection that the actor has explained a telephone conversation he had with Taylor two days before the murder. The woman whose name has been mentioned professes entire ignorance as to both the motive and the facts of the crime... Captain Adams yesterday declared that an arrest would be made within twenty-four hours, probably less. 'Working secretly, and while the suspected murderer believed that suspicion was falling on another person,' he said, 'detectives from my office have woven a chain of evidence that we believe is unbreakable. 'The net of evidence about this man is tightening like the inexorable tentacles of a deep sea monster. The motive has been established, the activities of the suspect have been checked to the night of the murder and detectives will locate his hiding place easily when the links in the chain are complete. 'A woman may have been, and possibly was, the indirect cause of the crime, but no woman directed the murderer in this case.'
1922-02-05	Mabel Normand Reenacts Scene in Tavlor's Rooms: Inquest Suddenly Halted   Action Taken as Police Precaution Jealousy and Revenge Still Motives on Which Authorities Are Working Mystery Deepened by Fact Slain Man Lived Under Two Names. Brother said to have Disappeared in 1912.   Loss Angeles. Feb. 4 (By the Associted Press. The force of detectives investigating the slaying of William D. Taylor, motion picture director, formerly known as William Cunningham Deane-Tanner, accompanied by Miss Mabel Normand, film actress, late today paid a visit to the house where Taylor was shot to death. Miss Normand, at the request of the deterlives, reenacted the scene at the Tay lor apartments Wednesday night when she called there and left shortly before the time the police say the tragedy occurred. Miss Normand said she was in the apartments about 45 minutes. all the time being passed in the livingroon where Taylor 's body was found the next morning. She pointed out the positions of the various pieces of furniture in the room and indicated where she and Taylor conversed. Taylor walked with her to her automobile and conversed with her chauffer and herself for a few moments, she explained further, leaving the front door of his apartments open. His only servant had left about 15 minutes before, to be gone for the night. A check was being made tonight upon the movements of several persons Wednesday night. it was stated. at police headiuarters, at least one of these being a man connected will the motion picture industry. it also was stated that an important witness had been located and might be quesioned tonight.   Allus Deepens Mystery The mystery surrounding the murher of Taylor was deepened today by the discovery that he was formerly known as William Cunningham DeaneTanner. The inquest held today lasted less than 45 minutes and resulted in an open verdict, the jury declaring Taylor came to his death from a gunshot wound inflicted by an unknown peran with homicidal intent. Practically the only new developsent in the inquest testimony was that the bullet which ended Taylor 's he ranged upward after entering the body on the rear of the left side about  ? inches above the hip and lodged near the shoulder. This indicated, according to detectives, the slayer fired from a reclining position or that Tayor was bending over when the shot was fired.   Mabel Normand Testifies. Miss Mabel Normand was the only one of a number of motion picture actors and actresses subpoenaed who was called to the stand. She testified he called upon Taylor Wednesday night, leaving at 7:45, or about fifteen minutes before a shot was heard by he neighbors. Mrs. Douglas MacLean, one of those who told of hearing the shoot was at the inquest, but was not called to the stand. A detective, however, testified Mrs. MacLean told him at after she heard the shot she went her door and looked across a court and saw a man standing at Taylor 's door. The detective named two others who, he said, told him they heard a shot. The coroner 's jury asked him if by gave any explanatien why the made no investigation at the time, He applied they said they thought the and might have been made by an exploding tire, The deceased was referred to as “Taylor" throughout the quest.

Investigators said they had the word of a witness they believed unimpeachable that Sands was in this city last Tuesday.   Things Sands has Clue. The police said they believed Sands. also known as Edward Fitz Stravamore, was in concealment because of his fear of having to face the grand larceny charge. They said they had established almost conclusively that was in Loss Angeles a few days ago, and they were also sure that he did not left since his last known ovements were traced. They said! they were not preferring additional: charges against Sands, but that they believed an interview with him would  assist them in clearing away the story. The investigation today. it was said, was devoted largely to the subject of motive, The police have been: from the beginning of the opinion that, Taylor was slain for revenge. at it was admitted that up to late today it had not been determined at any one entertained an animos  ly. for Taylor of such a degree as would appear to be an incentive to I murder. The possibility that jealousy might have been the cause of the saying was still receiving attention. it was declared. The discovery that Taylor had once gone by another name several years ago, during a residence in New York was received by the police with much interest, and it was said that this might prove an important element in the case. Inspection of the Taylorr residence was completed by finger-print experts. who announced Hky had found ne impressions of her clues.   allet at ingsest. The bullet which was taken from taylor 's body was produced at the inquest, then returned to detectives who are endeavoring to learn its history. The missile was found practicallly intact and retained its shape. LA County Autopsy Surgeon Wagner said, to its not having struck  bone during its passage through Taylors body. The bullet was declared none of unusual type, a distinguishing feature being a groove around if circumference near the base.

Miss Windsor said that Taylor in this connection declared., I ever lay my hands on Sands I will kill him. Air.

1922-02-05	DECLARES TAYLOR MAN WITHOUT FOES   Film Actress, Former Fiancee Gives Out Personal Incidents. in Slain Director's Life.   DAUGHTERS ADDRESS FOUND   Safety Deposit Box Reveals Estate of $60,000 Recent Suspicious Incidents Exposed.   Los Angeles. Calif, Feb. 4, By the Associated Press. Neva  Gerber. film actress, who said she had once been engaged to marry William Desmond Taylor, slain motion picture director, said the engagement had been broken off because They "both believed it an unsuitabie match,” "I have never known a finer, better man than Mr. Taylor," said Miss Gerber. "He was the soul of honor, a man of exceptional culture. education and refinement, but possessing a reserve which very few were permitted to penetrate. "So far as I know he did not have an enemy in the world, although he mentioned casually fights he had on his various trips to the Klondike.

The priest fell a victim and Mr. Taylor nursed him back to health, “Then, Mr. Taylor caught the disease and after a hard battle, the priest nursed him back, tohealth. "In spite of this experience. he often longed for the far North and he used to talk about it in the rests between scenes in pictures. He told me he had made two fortunes and spent both of them upon this return from Alaska. "He often spoke of his mother, then in Londonand his little daughter. He always termed the latter a 'child' and was planning to bring her to Los Angeles, It was my understanding his former wife was living in New York.. I always assurhed he was di vorced, for had he not been he would not, I believe, have asked me to marry him. We were engaged for some time but broke off the match two years ago whenhe concluded were were not suited to each other.   No known Enemies. This terrible affair is all the more mysterions because it was a common saying among the studios and in Hollywood generally that Mr Taylor had not an enemy in the world. "He may have made an enemy in the past who nursed a grudge through the years which finally resulted in his murder be he never  gave the slightest indication to me of  having any foe." official search of Taylors safety deposit box in bank here, disclosed a letter to him from the daughter, Ethel Daisy Taylor, postmarked at Mamoreneck, N.

1922-02-05	Slain Director was Three Years Miner in Colorado   Denver, Colo., Feb. 4.-William Desmond Taylor spent three years as a mining prospector in Colorado, according to Fred E. Carroll, of Denver former State mining conmissioner, of Colorado. Mr. Carroll described Taylor as having been of very "mysterious" turn of mind, talking of his own affairs very little. A Denver newspaper man who visited Taylor last year in Los Angeles, recalled tonight that Taylor had relayed to a party of friends at his studio that he was born in Ireland, left home to follow the stage and finally came to America when 18 years old.  According to the newspaper writer, Taylor said he went first to Harper, Kans.  Later he returned to his home, where his father, upon receiving a promise from young Taylor that he would not follow the stage, gave Taylor a college education. After graduating in engineering, Taylor, however again came to America in his hope to "get rich quick," he told his friends. According to the newspaper writer, he came to Colorado and prospected near Ouray and Silverton. Later he said he made several trips to Alaska in search of "gold and adventure." 
1922-02-05	SLAIN MOVIE MAN HAD CAREER HERE; DESERTED HIS WIFE Taylor Is Revealed as W. C. Deane-Tanner, who Disappeared in 1908. WIFE IS NOW MRS. ROBINS She and Daughter Later Recognized Him in Film and Met Him on His Way to Europe. BROTHER ALSO LEFT FAMILY Los Angeles Inquest Results In Formal Verdict Without Hearing All Actresses Called. The murder of William Desmond Taylor in Hollywood, which was found yesterday by a Coroner's jury at Los Angeles to be the work of an unknown assassin, has served to bring to light the past life of himself and his brother in New York, where they were known under their rightful name of Deane-Tanner, and to reveal curious coincidences in the lives of both men. Both apparently abandoned their wives and children and vanished, the elder to turn up as Taylor, the moving picture director of unusual ability, and the younger to remain a mystery. Taylor was William Cunningham Deane-Tanner, a member of a good family of Dublin, Ireland. He married Miss Ethel May Harrison, a member of the  original Florodora company, whose right name was Hamilton. She was the daughter of a broker. Taylor abandoned her in 1908, and in 1914 she got a divorce and married Edward L. C. Robins, Treasurer of the S. M. Robins Company, which conducts a number of restaurants in the financial district and owns Delmonico's restaurant. When Mrs. Robins heard yesterday that bits of her former husband's past life in New York were becoming known, and that her marriage to him was known, she issued a statement in which she definitely established that Taylor, the murdered moving picture man, and Deane-Tanner, the former dealer in English antiques on Fifth Avenue, were the same person. "I married in December, 1901, Mr.  William Cunningham Deane-Tanner of Dublin, Ireland," said Mrs. Robins. "He disappeared in October 1908. We could assign no reason for his disappearance except possible aphasia. In 1912 I got a decree of divorce in the State of New York, and was awarded the custody of my only child, Ethel Daisy Deane-Tanner, now 19, in August 1914, I married Edward L. C. Robins. "Two and a half years ago I discovered that William Desmond Taylor had been Mr. Deane-Tanner. I have no further statement which possibly could be of interest. The news of Mr. DeaneTanner's death was a great shock to my daughter and me." Wife Absolves Him of Blame. Mrs. Robins was seen later at her home in Mamaroneck, a cottage about two miles south of the station, and talked more freely about her first husband, whom she absolved of all blame in leaving her because she thought he was mentally upset at the time. She also revealed that she had met him in New York for a few moments before he sailed for Europe about a year ago, and that her daughter had been in constant correspondence with him. Mrs. Robins is an attractive woman. She was dressed in a dark blue silk frock and wore a golden ornament on a black silk cord about her neck. She is a woman of charm and courtesy, terms which she applied to Deane-Tanner in describing him. The exact reason for Deane-Tanner leaving his home has always been a mystery to her, and she never asked him about it after her daughter began to  write to him or when she saw him at the pier. "It was just like a man pickup his hat to leave the house," was the way she put it. He left all his clothes, his money, and sufficient means to provide for her. He had occasionally suffered severely from neuralgia and she thought this had affected his mind. He once told his daughter that he had had a lapse of memory for a year after he left New York. The way in which Mrs. Robins learned that her first husband was not dead was dramatic. She and her daughter  were at a moving picture theatre on3 day two and a half years ago when suddenly Deane-Tanne appeared on the sereen as one to of the principal characters in the play. She recognized him immediately, although he was without the mustache which he had worn when she was married to him. "That is your father," she exclaimed to her daughter, and her daughter then recognized him also from a photograph she had seen. They saw that he was using the name William Desmond Taylor and the daughter wrote to him in care of the moving picture company in whose productions he was appearing. He answered his daughter's letter, and they kept up a regular correspondence. He once came to New York, she said, and met his daughter. They had a long talk together. He was delighted to see her as she was to see him. He told his daughter then that he was not remarried, and Mrs. Robins says she is sure from what he said that he was telling the truth. He intimated that he would leave his property to his daughter in his will, Mrs. Robins said. Deane-Tanner was of a fine old Irish family, Mrs. Robins said, the son of a Major in the British Army. He was a member of the British Public Schools association, which comprises alumni from the famous public schools of Eton and Harrow and was also an English university man. He had two brothers and two sisters, but Mrs. Robins knew only the one brother. Mrs. Robins said that she got her diorce on statutory grounds in New York, but that she did not name a corespondent. She said that she had no complaint to make of him, and that she could not imagine how any one could have had sufficient cause to kill him. In his dealings with others he was always considerate, she said, and every one liked him. The daughter is now attending an art school in New York, but Mrs. Robins could not say which one because she does not want her daughter brought into the case. She was asked if she could go to California, and said that would all depend on circumstances. Brother 's Record Uncovered. The murder of Taylor which led to the discovery of his first marriage and his abandonment of his wife, a chapter which Mrs. Robins had hoped was forgotten, also curiously enough resulted in uncovering the past history of his brother Dennis Deane-Tanner, who also married in New York and left his wife when she was recovering from a severe illness in the Adirondacks, and his two children. Both men had been connected with antique shops and both had vanished so completely that their New York friends never again came in contact with them. The picture of Taylor as a man austere and scholarly, who paid little attention to women, as drawn by some of his moving-picture associates. was  also shattered, for there are persons in the city who, while admitting that both the Deane-Tanners had been men of culture and pleasing personalities, said that their affairs with women had been such that no one who knew them could help noticing them. Just when the Deane-Tanners came to this country was not definitely estabished yesterday but it is believed that William, the elder brother, came here originally about thirty years ago while very young and went to Runnymede, a settlement near Harper, Kan., estabisied by Ned Turnley in 1887 or 1888 for emittance men-the impecunious sons of English society. There was a young man named Tanner in the colony for a short time, and old residents of Harper said yesterday that they remembered him, and that he left the colony in a short time and went back to England or Ireland. He later returned to this country but did not go back to Runnymede. The next heard of Tanner was when he married Miss Harrison in 1901, and when he later became Vice President of the English Antique Shop, conducted by A. J. Crawford, at 240 or 246 Fifth Avenue, between Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth Streets. His wife was known as a very accomplished woman, who had been well educated by her father when he was well to do and was a planist of some ability. Deane-Tanner was handsome and gallant, popular with all who knew him. He was active in the affairs of the Larchmont Yacht Club between 1904 and 1908, when he disappeared, and was a member of the Art Committee. Drank Heavily Before Disappearance. He began to drink quite heavily shorty before his disappearance, and it was thought by those who knew him that he was unhappy. A few days before he disappeared he went to the Vanderbilt Cup race on Long Island and it was said yesterday by his associates of those days than he started on a "spree" that wound up in the old Continental Hotel, which in those days was on Broadwav at Nineteenth Street. He sent to his office for $600 to be sent to him quickly. It was delivered to him at the hotel and he was never seen again in New York. A few years of Deane-Tanner's life drop out of the story here, and he next turned up on the Pacific Coast. He is supposed to have wandered up to Alaska, where he became ill in Nome, and later to have found his way back to San Francisco. He was down and out then, a wreck of the former handsome man who sold women expensive antiques and played around the yacht club. He had been friendly in New York with the husband of Eleanor Gordon, an actress, and they found him one day in San Francisco, where he was just out of hospital. They sent him to Los Angeles to get his health back, supplied him with money, and when he was well again got him work with a moving picture company. He acted a little, became a director, and after that his success was rapid. For two years during the war he was an officer in the Canadian Army. When he was shot he was in the position of having his productions featured under his name in stead of that of the star who played in them. Dennis Deane-Tanner was much the same type of man. He was younger and had served in the British Army as Lieutenant during the Boer war. He came to New York after his brother had married, and also went into the antique business, being associated with A. S. Vernay on East Forty-fifth Street. He was manager there and was looked upon as the counterpart in courtesy and culture of his brother. He married Miss Ada Brennan in 1907, and had two children, and at the time he disappeared lived at 247 West 101th Street. He was a vigorous, athletic man and was a member of the New York Athletic Club. Dennis Deane-Tanner 's wife became ill, and went to the Adirondacks to recover, leaving her children with her husand and her mother. Vernay returned from Europe the day before Dennis disappeared, and his manager met him and went with him to the shop to discuss business. That was the last Mr. Vernay saw of him. The next morning Dennis kissed his children and left the house in good spirits. He never retumed. Search for Dennis in Vain. Mrs. Deane-Tanner came back from the mountains and with the help of the police conducted a long search for her husband without success. So did an insurance company which had insured his life. His accounts were in good shape, and there was nothing to account for his disappearance, unless it was that he craved more freedom to follow his own desires. From time to time rumors came back to the Vernay shop that Dennis had changed his name and gone into the moving picture business. What started these rumors nobody knew yesterday, they were the more remarkable because until Taylor was killed none of his New York associates knew that the moving picture man was the man who had left the City in 1908. There was some speculation yesterday as to whether Taylor had sent for his brother and persuaded him to alter his life, as he himself had done. If Dennis did go into moving pictures, he changed his name so completely that a search of books on the moving picture industry failed to reveal a man who would suggest the former New Yorker. The possibility that Dennis DeaneTanner did actually drop out of life more completely than his brother is suggested by the later connection between William and his brother's wife. She went to Monrovia, Cal., where she has relatives, and has been living at 426 Lennon or Lemon Avenue. A search of the dead man 's papers showed that he had been giving her a monthly allowance, which would indicate that he was as ignorant as she of his brother's whereabouts; or, it was suggested, he may have been acting as his brother's agent in transferring to her money for her support.   
1922-02-06	(from an interview with actress Winifred Kingston)..Miss Kingston threw some very interesting light on Sands' career, details gleaned, she said, from various conversations with Taylor. 'While Edward Knoblock was living at Mr. Taylor's home [during June/July 1921 when Taylor was in Europe], ' she said, 'Sands went down to a well known department store in town and bought at various times a considerable amount of lingerie. I understood he gave these to a girl he was interested in--a very young creature who lived at home with her mother. All of this he charged to Mr. Taylor's account, a matter which greatly enraged the director when he returned from abroad. ...'During this same period, when Mr. Knoblock was a guest of Mr. Taylor's and was supposed to pay for nothing, Sands presented the English author with a bill amounting to some hundreds of dollars for groceries he had used while at the house. Mr. Knoblock, being a gentleman and not wanting a row, however little he understood the matter, paid the bill. When Mr. Taylor returned he was naturally dumbfounded. 'On another occasion Sands did another peculiar thing. Mr. Taylor had two thermos bottles around the house, neither of any particular value. There were many other things Sands easily could have stolen of more value. But he took one of these bottles to present to some girl. Her mother did not understand the act at all and didn't want the girl to take it. 'Most unusual of Sands' actions, however, was a document he once drew up. 'One day, to show his affection and regard for Mr. Taylor, he wrote, in his own handwriting, a sort of servile contract, in which he said that he would be Mr. Taylor's servant for life and would always be his slave. 'Mr. Taylor told me about the document and laughed. I don't know what ever happened to the paper, but Sands apparently took it seriously. 'All of this led me to believe that the man was mentally deranged and he is the only man I can think of who might have killed Mr. Taylor.'
1922-02-06	(Los Angeles)--...The fact that his houseman, Henry Peavey, and his former secretary, Edward F. Sands, are both said to be 'queer persons,' has led to much speculation whether Taylor was abnormal himself. It is thought by a majority who are investigating the case that this is a phase which will develop and throw much new light on the case.
1922-02-06	Several detectives were inclined to the theory that the person who slew Taylor may have been mentally unbalanced, and qualified their remarks regarding that phase of the probe by discussing confidential reports obtained today from the mystery witness who called at detective headquarters and who was said to have stated he saw Sands near the scene of the slaying late Wednesday night.
1922-02-06	Following the detention earlier in the day of a suspect and two material witnesses in the Taylor murder case, the escape of the slayer of William Desmond Taylor from the dimly-lighted court on South Alvarado street was re- enacted last night in the very shadows where the murderer lurked last Wednesday night awaiting his chance to kill the famous film director. The dramatic action was precipitated by the taking into custody of three men by Al Manning, criminal superintendent of the Sheriff's office, and Deputy Sheriff Harvey Bell. The suspect and the two men who were wanted as material witnesses against him were detained after an investigation lasting two days, and as the result of information that an automobile said to resemble one owned by the suspect was seen at the scene of the crime on the night of the 1st inst. The suspect was taken to the scene of the crime after a long cross- examination at the Sheriff's office, and after he was unable to state definitely where he was at the time Taylor was killed. Accompanied by his captor and Detective Sergeant Herman H. Cline, the man was taken to the vicinity of the slaying for the purpose of re-enacting the tragedy. No positive identification was made, however, and the man was released, with instructions to remain in touch with the investigating officers. The suspect is a motion-picture actor. He admitted the ownership of the automobile, but denied he was the man seen leaving the Alvarado street court. Immediately after the suspect was taken away from the vicinity, Capt. Adams, Detectives Cline, Cahill and Cato, in charge of the investigation, and several members of the motion-picture interests, now working in an effort to solve the slaying of one of their members went into conference in the Taylor apartment. A new reconstruction of the crime, and a general checking up of all known facts and factors in the case was the purpose of the gathering, according to the announcement by the officers and by Frank E. Garbutt and Charles F. Eyton, general manager of the Famous Players-Lasky Company. 'We are going to take every known fact and factor and check all available information. We have nothing new, but we want to make certain of all we have,' was the only announcement after the conference. The large table in the Taylor apartment was piled high with papers and letters when the officers and film officials went into the conference. A thorough check of every document, picture, telegram and letter was promised, with a view of gleaning, if possible, some clew that would assist in the search for the slayer. None of the furniture in the room has been disturbed. The half-dozen detectives detailed to the solution of the crime yesterday were particularly active. The chocolate-colored automobile seen to leave the vicinity of the Taylor home at 404-B South Alvarado street has been identified, it was learned, and eliminated as bearing on the case. Henry Peavey, colored houseman for Mr. Taylor, and the man who found the body, yesterday was in conference with some of the detectives. He is declared to have wanted to leave Los Angeles to go north and sought permission to do so. He is said to have added little new information to the case. Peavey left the Taylor home while Mabel Normand was there and more than a half hour before the assassin shot his victim through the heart. Many letters, bills and other correspondence found among the effects of Mr. Taylor were closely examined during the day for possible information. Among those letters were messages of greeting and friendly notes from many film stars including Blanche Sweet and Gloria Swanson. The correspondence and other papers including many canceled checks threw considerable light on the acquaintances and activities of Mr. Taylor but little on the question of who shot him. Detectives Cahill and Cato responded to a 'hot tip' early in the afternoon coming from a downtown address but nothing definite developed. A great number of 'tips' have been reported to the police station and although many of them are not regarded as valuable on the surface all are being carefully checked that no clew be overlooked. Throughout all the investigation thus far the name of Edward F. Sands or Edward Fitz or Edward Fitz Strathmore--all of which names he used-0-has been prominently projected into the mystery. Sands, a former secretary who was accused of robbing Mr. Taylor and of forging many checks on his bank account, is being sought. The police are anxious to find him because of the knowledge he may have of Mr. Taylor's past life. The uncovering of the dual existence led by the prominent director, whose name became a household word throughout the country, has strangely muddled the situation. Many new motives and possibilities have been brought to the front because of Taylor's dual life and mysterious past. The discovery of a deserted wife and daughter who knew Mr. Taylor as William Cunningham Deane Taylor [sic] before he suddenly left New York in 1908 has been one of the puzzling chapters in the man's past life. His frequent trips to the Far North also add color to many theories of real or fancied wrongs of his acquaintances in his wandering days forming the background of a revenge slaying. Mabel Normand's missing letters were sought by the detectives yesterday. Miss Normand probably the last friend to see Mr. Taylor alive, attempted Saturday to recover some letters written by her to the slain man and known to have been in the home. Detective Sergeants Herman Cline, Cato, Cahill, Winn, Wallace and Zeigler state they have not found these letters. Captain of Detectives Adams also denies having them. The officers say they do not know who has them. Chief Dep. Dist.-Atty. Doran says also that he has seen nothing of them.
1922-02-06	Mr. Taylor loved Miss Normand very much, but I do not believe that she returned his love to any great extent.' This is what Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored house servant, said early yesterday evening when questioned by reporters of The Times. 'I was in Mr. Taylor's house for almost six months,' declared Peavey, 'and I know that Mr. Taylor was very much in love with Miss Normand. At times I thought that she returned his love and then again it seemed to me that she was tired of him. 'One night almost a month before Mr. Taylor was killed Miss Normand came to the house for dinner. After dinner she went into the front room with Mr. Taylor and they were talking. I passed through the room and she stopped me. She told me then that she and Mr. Taylor were to be married. He was sitting there and didn't say a word. She wanted to know if I would work for them and I told her that I was afraid that I would be unable to please her. She stated that I was pleasing Mr. Taylor and that therefore I would please her. 'Miss Normand never came to the house very often. During the time I worked there she was only in Mr. Taylor's home about a dozen times. She was there the night before the murder and again the night that Mr. Taylor was killed. I know that she was with Mr. Taylor on the Tuesday night, before the Wednesday that he was killed, because she told me so. Wednesday night when she came in Mr. Taylor asked her to have some pudding. She said while I was in the room that she did not care for any pudding that night, but had enjoyed the pudding that she had the night before. Then I learned for the first time what had happened to some pudding that I had left in the ice box on Tuesday night and that was gone Wednesday morning when I arrived at the Taylor home. 'In my job as houseman I was in a position to know quite a bit about Mr. Taylor's business. He wrote a litter to Miss Normand almost every day of the week. His driver would take the notes to Miss Normand's home by automobile after breakfast in the mornings. A week never went by that he did not write to her at least three times. 'Mr. Taylor always sent Miss Normand flowers at least three times a week. He purchased the flowers from a wholesale place on Los Angeles street between Second and Third streets. Once I paid for some of them, the single bunch cost $35. He would have the flowers sent out from the wholesale house direct. 'While Miss Normand was in New York finishing her last picture Mr. Taylor send her a telegram every evening of his life. He would give them to me and I sent them on my way home. I always gave them to the same girl in the Western Union main office. She is still working there. Miss Normand answered his telegrams and almost every morning just after I arrived at the Taylor home the boy would come with Miss Normand's telegram. Mr. Taylor saved them all, but I don't know where he kept them. 'I remember one evening when Miss Normand was with Mr. Taylor in his home she saw his new music box and while I was in the room she asked him if they were going to have one like it when they were married. He told her that they would keep the one he had just purchased if she liked it. 'A year ago last Christmas Miss Normand gave Mr. Taylor a set of diamond shirt studs and diamond cuff links. Last Christmas she sent him a large silver cigarette case and a match holder and a cigarette holder. Some time after Christmas the match and cigarette holder disappeared, but he had the case on him the night that he died. I don't know what Mr. Taylor gave Miss Normand for Christmas, but I know that he was always sending her something or other. 'Mr. Taylor used to talk to Miss Normand over the telephone a great deal. He always asked me to get the number for him. Sometimes some one would answer me and when I said that Mr. Taylor wished to speak to Miss Normand they would hang up the telephone. It was then that I would believe that Miss Normand did not care for my master like he did for her. 'Only once during the time that I worked for Mr. Taylor did Miss Normand ask me about other girls. She stopped me once when she was in the home and ask me what other girls had dinner with Mr. Taylor. I told her that there was only one. She ask me who the one was an I told, Miss Normand. She laughed at me and said that Mr. Taylor had me well trained. 'Miss Normand was with Mr. Taylor the last time I saw him alive. My master asked me to mix up some cocktails and I did. I placed the liquor in the shaker on a tray with two glasses and Mr. Taylor and Miss Normand were drinking when I left for the evening. They both said good night to me and I left the house. When I next saw Mr. Taylor he was dead on the floor of his living-room.'
1922-02-06	A woman's pink silk nightgown found in the bachelor apartments of William Desmond Taylor, celebrated film director, who was slain in his home last Wednesday night, yesterday added another puzzling phase to the deepening mystery of circumstances surrounding his death. From former employees of Mr. Taylor it was learned that silken things unknown in a man's wardrobe were among the effects of Mr. Taylor. That the police found evidence of this was learned for the first time yesterday, following the stories related by two former employees. Henry Peavey, the houseman who discovered the body on Thursday morning, declared he had seen at least one pink silk nightgown there. In connection with this, it also was learned yesterday how Edward F. Sands, former secretary, accused robber and forger and now being sought as a material witness in the murder case, spied on his employer while working for Mr. Taylor. Sands related his observations to Earl Tiffany, former chauffeur for Mr. Taylor, so Mr. Tiffany says. He observed silken things of pink hue in the upstairs rooms of the expensively appointed apartment. His curiosity was aroused. So Sands folded the garments in a trick manner, according to the story related by Mr. Tiffany, who was employed at the same time as was Sands. The result of the servant's trap were that he became convinced the garments were not merely kept there for sentimental reasons. He paid particular attention to the visitors to the Taylor home, it was declared, and drew his own conclusions. Peavey stated last night he remembered seeing at least one pink nightgown. If his memory serves him right, he added, it was there the day Mr. Taylor was killed. Police officers yesterday were evasive as to the whereabouts of the lingerie. They declined to say whether or not they are devoting part of their efforts to that phase of the mystery.
1922-02-06	On the desk of William Desmond Taylor stood one framed photograph. In his entire bungalow, filled with photos of celebrities and friends, mostly women, this picture alone was framed--and framed beautifully in naturally finish hardwood. It was the likeness of Winifred Kingston, film star. 'Engaged ever?' Miss Kingston was asked yesterday in her beautiful West Hollywood home. 'Ridiculous!' 'Mr. Taylor and I were the best of friends--nothing more. I knew him perhaps as intimately as any woman friend could, but there had never been a whisper or thought of love between us. Certainly not. 'It so happened that both Mr. Taylor and I were English--that is, he was Irish, but a British subject and educated as an Englishman and with the British army traditions behind him and his family. 'We Britishers are naturally reserved and don't usually tell intimate things to others. But early in the history of the films, Mr. Taylor and I became acquainted, back in the 'Balboa' days. As I was English we became somewhat more friendly than most and at various times he told me many things, perhaps, which everyone did not know. 'For example, he told me about having been married and having a child, and also about having been divorced. I never thought anything in particular about it and don't even remember the occasion of his telling me--whether I asked him or whether he volunteered the information. 'But any number of us in the film colony knew his and those who didn't know had to reason to--they weren't the sort of people or weren't close enough to Mr. Taylor to be told. I don't see why any one is surprised to learn about that. 'It's not unusual, either, that he should have had my photograph on his desk. He directed me in any number of pictures and for years we have been good friends. I gave him that picture for Christmas one year and he probably had it framed as a matter of course. 'As a matter of fact, one is more liable to frame a picture of an old, though platonic friend, that a picture of one in whom he is but momentarily interested. 'I never knew, of course, that he had changed his name on coming out here, but that fact doesn't seem to be important. 'As a matter of fact, I don't see where any of this old history is important in the solution of the mystery of his death. I think everything points to this man Sands.' Miss Kingston threw some very interesting light on Sands' career, details gleaned, she said, from various conversations with Taylor. 'While Edward Knoblock was living at Mr. Taylor's home,' she said, 'Sands went down to a well known department store in town and bought at various times a considerable amount of lingerie. I understood he gave this to a girl he was interested in--a very young creature who lived at home with her mother. All of this he charged to Mr. Taylor's account, a matter which greatly enraged the director when he returned from abroad. 'Sands had frequently done shopping for him, but Mr. Taylor told me humorously that he would hardly have sent a servant to pick out ladies' underwear. 'During this same period, when Mr. Knoblock was a guest of Mr. Taylor's and was supposed to pay for nothing, Sands presented the English author with a bill amounting to some hundreds of dollars for groceries he had used while at the house. Mr. Knoblock, being a gentleman and not wanting a row, however little he understood the matter, paid the bill. When Mr. Taylor returned he was naturally dumbfounded. 'On another occasion Sands did another peculiar thing. Mr. Taylor had two thermos bottles around the house, neither of any particular value. There were many other things Sands easily could have stolen of more value, but he took one of these bottles to present to some girl. Her mother did not understand the act at all and didn't want the girl to take it. 'Most unusual of Sands' actions, however, was a document he once drew up. 'One day, to show his affection and regard for Mr. Taylor, he wrote, in his own handwriting, a sort of servile contract, in which he said that he would be Mr. Taylor's servant for life and would always be his slave. 'Mr. Taylor told me about the document and laughed. I don't know what every happened to the paper, but Sands apparently took it seriously. 'All of this led me to believe that the man was mentally deranged and he is the only man I can think of who might have killed Mr. Taylor.' Miss Kingston said that she could find no possible intimation or statement made by Taylor to her that might form the basis for a motive growing out of an old feud. Nothing of the kind was ever said to her, she stated.
1922-02-06	Baring in detail her entire acquaintance with William D. Taylor for the past seven years Miss Neva Gerber, his former fiancee, yesterday afternoon graphically told of his fits of utter despondency that gripped the dead man at times and of his many mysterious disappearances, for two and three weeks at a time continuing over a period of several years, and admitted that she had received thousands of dollars in checks from the dead director. 'At times Mr. Taylor would sink to such depths of despair, said Miss Gerber, 'that his whole body seemed racked as if in physical torture. He would walk the floor and wring his hands exclaiming, 'Why do I have to keep up this battle? Is it worth while to keep up this struggle of existence? With all of these odds against me is the struggle worth while?' and when I would ask him what he meant by these strange words he would say, 'Oh, my health is so bad--I have no stomach left--I can't eat anything,' but there were other times when he would say 'I have had bad news from home,' but he never told me just what the news was. 'There would be times just after he had finished directing a picture when he would say he was so nervous he would have to go away for awhile and that he was going out into the mountains where he could rest and would see no one. Sometimes he would be gone as long as three weeks and I would not hear from him, although he would telegraph from some nearby point just as he was leaving and just before his return. Once he told me that had been driving down from the Northern part of the State alone for three days and later when mentioning an incident of the trip he said 'the man who was with me in the car said this was a dangerous piece of road.' I said 'I thought you were alone,' and he very plausibly explained it was a man he had picked up and was giving a lift, and although I did not exactly have any suspicions about anything I often wondered about these trips. 'It is true that Mr. Taylor gave me three cars, first an old one that he had used and later two new ones which were purchased in my name. When he began giving me presents of jewelry, automobiles and--' Miss Gerber hesitated and blushed--'and money, we were engaged, we expected to be married as soon as I got my divorce and it did not seem anything out of the way to either of us. When we first began going together Mr. Taylor had less financial resources than I had myself. When we would go out to dinner together when I was first working with the Balboa Film Company we would many times pool all of our spare change and decide where we could afford to eat. 'He always said that I had been a square pal with him and when he began making really big money he seemed to think it was just the natural thing to divide what he had with me. When our engagement was broken off about two years ago we did not have any quarrel; there were not harsh words or even bitter feeling. After he came back from the army he seemed more melancholy and despondent than he had been before. He would even be irritable at times, so my mother said that as I had had such an unfortunate experience in my marriage to one man who was much older than myself that it was not wise to make another venture of the same kind. Both she and I talked to him about this and we decided to end the engagement. After that time I never went out with him. I did not see him for months at a time, although he frequently phoned, and he came to the house a few times. He was always just as pleasant to both my mother and myself as he had ever been, and he continued to make me little presents of money, by check, sometimes $75, sometimes $100. 'A little over a year ago I started my own company and put quite a bit of my own money into the venture and it has not brought returns as rapidly as I had expected. Some time about the 9th of January, 1922, I was talking to Mr. Taylor on the telephone and told him that things were in pretty much of a jam, and that I was in temporary financial straits, and he said he would let me have some money, and about the 11th day of the same month he sent me a check for $500. 'I have never kept any record of the amounts given me, but his generosity has continued over a number of years and I suppose his gifts would amount, all told, to several thousand dollars. Mr. Taylor used to depend on me to look after many things for him. It was I who found the house for him in which he was living at the time of his death, and when he and I were engaged and were going out together I would frequently stop there for a few minutes, but there was always a servant present. 'When Mr. Taylor frequently betrayed such an intimate knowledge of works of art of every description I would say to him, 'How did you learn so much about period furniture and tapestries and everything like that?' he would reply, 'Oh, I used to chum around with a man in New York who was an art collector and an authority on the subject and he taught me all I know.' And he would often refer casually to his life in New York. Sometimes, but very infrequently, he would speak of his people in England. He said he had a sister and a mother there and that his child was with his mother in England. When he returned from the war he told me that his sister's husband had been killed in battle and that both his mother and child had been killed in a German air raid over London. He never spoke of having a brother or a sister- in-law. 'Although I know of his former wife--he had described her to me as a very beautiful blonde--I never suspected that he had lived under a different name or that there was anything in his past which he needed or wished to conceal. Once when I was crying over something he became infuriated and told me never to do so again in his presence as it crazed him and rendered him so irresponsible he felt like striking a woman who cried. He then told me that his former wife's crying had been the thing which had made it impossible for him to live with her, but that is the only thing he ever said about their differences. 'But he frequently referred in a vague way to great sorrows he had had and of not making the most he might out of his life. I would try to cheer him up by telling him of what a wonderful director he had become in such a short time and that he had great fame and success ahead of him, and sometimes he would throw off his despairing mood but it began to return more and more frequently. I do not think the general public knew anything about this despondent side of him as he was a very silent and self-contained man. 'Because of his unhappy moods and his loneliness I had frequently begged him not to live alone, but to take a room at a club or a hotel but he said he could only work when entirely isolated and that he loved solitude. I had not seen him for several weeks previous to the murder and I have not the slightest conception or theory as to what was the motive or who was the perpetrator of so cruel a deed.'
1922-02-06	Los Angeles, Feb. 5--Once, in an expansive mood, William Desmond Taylor, film director, whose murder last Wednesday was one of the most mysterious ever recorded in Los Angeles, talked intimately with his chauffeur, Lester Wing. 'I never really loved but one woman,' Taylor declared to the Chinese, according to the latter's story, told yesterday. 'She was my stage partner. I was engaged to her. But she died before we could be married--and I'll never marry another woman.' Wing was in Taylor's employ for several years before the film director deserted the land of make-believe to take part in the real, hard game of war. 'Mr. Taylor was a fine man,' Wing said. 'He was very good to his servants. And brave. Why, on the way to Bakersfield one time, a car sped around a curve ahead of us, threatening to run us off the road, but Mr. Taylor never flinched. 'Also, he trusted people too much, at times, I think. Once he trusted anyone it was forever. Many times he sent me to deposit money in the bank-- $1,500, $2,000, and sometimes as high as $3,000 in money and checks. 'Once a lady from New York sent him a telegram asking to help her. She was in need. He sent me to the telegraph office with $200 in cash to send to her. 'He taught me lots of things. Anything I ever wanted to know he would explain and make me understand.' The only woman with whom Taylor was friendly at the time of Wing's service was Neva Gerber, according to the Chinese. She was with Taylor several times a week. Two or three times a week it was Taylor's habit to call for his car, a beautiful gray one, and take a long ride alone. Often, Wing said, he would leave the car with the chauffeur and talk long, solitary walks. 'He would walk alone, eat alone, cook alone--everything alone,' the former chauffeur said. 'The only time he would want to see me would be to make appointments.' The high esteem in which Taylor was held by those with whom he transacted business was told by Mrs. Edna Goodwin of 1910 West Sixth street. 'We owned a garage near the Taylor home,' Mrs. Goodwin said. 'Mr. Taylor often came to us for gasoline and other service. That was three years ago before he entered the army. 'He had a buff colored chummy roadster, and there was always a young lady with him--generally the same one. As soon as we saw the car coming we'd run out, exclaiming: ''There's Bill Taylor; there's Bill Taylor.' 'We thought so much of him. And every one connected with the garage thought the same. He was a wonderful man. I can't understand why anyone would want to harm him. 'Taylor had a Chinese chauffeur at that time, Lester Wing. And after Taylor went away, Wing entered the service of another man. But he could not be consoled. He would often come in and say: ''I wish Mr. Taylor would come back, so I could be his chauffeur again. I'll never get another boss like him.''

1922-02-06	I sought those letters and hoped to get them before they reached the scrutiny of others. I admit this but it was for only one purpose--to prevent their terms of affection from being misconstrued. 'You see, just in a jest, Mr. Taylor called me 'Blessed Baby'--it started at dinner parties we attended together. And just to tease him, I called him--this great, big, stern-minded man--'Baby' in return. They were used in our letters, strictly in fun, and I feared, well, misunderstanding.' And this is the reason Mabel Normand, famous film star, told The Examiner yesterday that she sought so earnestly the missives exchanged between her and the slain motion-picture director, William Desmond Taylor, after the inquest Saturday. But the letters and telegrams she refers to are strangely missing. Following the second burglary of the Taylor bungalow, at 404 B South Alvarado street some weeks ago, they were found undisturbed when Taylor showed Miss Normand about the ransacked rooms. They were then in the top drawer of the dresser. 'Our letters exchanged were mostly 'joshing' ones, frivolous and jesting about the trivialities we had come upon since our last meeting. Some were of more serious import, explained why dinner engagements we had arranged had to be canceled,' Miss Normand said yesterday. 'Most of the Letters--there were eight or nine of them--were written when either he and I was in New York and sent from the Ritz-Carlton. One was when I was ill and told him the difficulty I had in purchasing certain types of golf balls he had requested me to purchase for him in the city. 'The telegrams, a half dozen of them, were of similar nature merely asking about the health of the other and telling him how I was enjoying the attractions in the metropolis. 'I seldom would sign my name, preferring to keep him guessing with a sketch of myself at the end of the letter. His calling me 'Blessed Baby'-- started at a dinner party--and he said it, of course, with a laugh, but it seemed so inconsistent from that stern-typed man--and I joshed him about it. Later, in the same laughing spirit, I called him by the equally inconsistent term 'Baby' and we continued it. But since I have feared that it would be misconstrued--that it would not appear to be as intended.' Then the famous picture star reverted in conversation to the night of the tragedy, when the director was slain a short time after he had escorted Miss Normand to her waiting automobile. 'There is a doubt yet in my mind but that the murderer was not in the house secreted during the time of my short visit with Mr. Taylor,' she said. 'I can't understand how he could have been brazen enough to have entered during the brief interim when Mr. Taylor came with me to the curbing. 'A mysterious part of it all was a telephone call he was receiving shortly before I visited his apartment to inquire about a book he was to lend me. He was helping me with my literary studies, you know, and treated me always with the courtesy of an adviser. 'My bell was answered by his colored servant, Henry Peavey, who told me Mr. Taylor was telephoning. Not wishing to eavesdrop on a private conversation I told Peavey I would wait outside. When Mr. Taylor heard my voice he hurriedly cut off his phone call and rushed to meet me with: ''Oh, I know why you have come. It is for the book I was to lend you.' We talked for about three quarters of an hour--it was just 7:45 that evening when I left him--and then he told me that he had some checks to mail out. He said he would phone to me about 9 and see how I enjoyed the start of the book. 'Shortly before this, Peavey who had been finishing his work in the kitchen, nodded a 'good night,' stopped for a short conversation with my chauffeur and went on his way. After Mr. Taylor had helped me with my wraps he took me to my car, where we talked for a moment about a magazine I had purchased. I then drove away, 'My opinion is that Mr. Taylor was murdered for a motive of revenge, but just why someone would seek vengeance is beyond my comprehension. Never in his conversation with me had he spoken of any enmity between him and others. And I never should have suspected it, as he was the type that seemed to make of everyone a devoted friend. 'In my opinion Mr. Taylor was of irreproachable morals, a typical gentleman, who seemed incapable of stooping to things of the questionable or dishonorable sort. To me he was always a kindly adviser in my efforts at mental improvement and to all who knew him he was an inspiration to the nobler and loftier things of life. 'If there is a possibility that the jealousy of another woman enters into the mystery,' Miss Normand continued, 'I feel certain that the phone call which he was receiving as I entered his apartment had something to do with it. 'Whoever it was calling him seemed intensely absorbed in what he had to say. And the hasty cutting off of the conversation might have aroused antagonism in any one interested in Mr. Taylor in a sentimental way. Perhaps the announcement of his servant, Peavey, that I had come was overheard by the person at the other end of the wire. And perhaps--who can tell--that it was this person who imagined jealousy and outraged feelings and came immediately to the apartment and committed the venomous deed. 'I did not ask him who it was that called, for I felt it was none of my business. Then again, he was not the type of man who lets others in on what he considered his private affairs. He was very secretive--almost seemed to place a barrier of mystery between him and his most intimate friends--and it was this mystic quality that gave him such marked fascination. 'Of this much I am thoroughly convinced: It was a man, not a woman, who fired the shot that killed Taylor. I know the feminine sex and feel certain that a woman would have had to take more than one shot to have had as deadly an effect as the one that brought about his demise. Perhaps in three or four efforts she might have done it--but not in one. 'The man who committed this deed was a sure shot and understood the gun game. He understood where to aim, and when--an experienced gunman. 'As for the disappearance of my letters I cannot account. I know of absolutely no one who would be interested in them. They have no significance of anything except the harmless friendship that existed between us. When I saw Mr. Taylor was keeping them I asked him why. And I remember yet his kindly countenance when he smiled and said: 'Oh--just because.' 'He often remonstrated with me because I did not write more frequently. But what I usually had to say was done over the phone or in his presence. 'I want everyone to know, however, that I am doing all I possibly can to aid in the solution of this tragic mystery,' she concluded. 'For Mr. Taylor was to me the very personification of kindliness and righteousness--the sort of man that made it an honor to be called his friend.'
1922-02-06	Los Angeles, Feb. 5--...A report of a threat made on the night of the murder also was being run down. This report, made by a business man to the police, was expected to set the officers on the trail of a man who is quoted as saying on the night Taylor was slain within a few minutes after Mabel Normand left the Taylor home: 'There will be a movie director show up missing in the morning.'... Capt. Adams said it was not impossible that Taylor was killed by a burglar, who seized upon the opportunity provided when Taylor escorted Miss Normand to her automobile to sneak in the house. The position of the bullet and the line of fire indicated shows, Capt. Adams said, that the assassin probably was crouching behind the door when Taylor entered... The fact that his houseman, Henry Peavey, and his former secretary, Edward F. Sands, are both said to be 'queer persons,' has led to much speculation whether Taylor was abnormal himself. It is thought by a majority who are investigating the case that this is a phase which will develop and throw much new light on the case. Other associates of the man are known to the police to be persons of vicious habits...
1922-02-06	...The shot that killed William Desmond Taylor was fired from a distance of only three or four inches. This startling discovery in the murder mystery was announced following a conference at police headquarters today between the officers investigating the crime. It was revealed when Detective Sergeant Edward King, detailed to duty at the district attorney's office, brought to the conference the clothing of the murdered movie director. Powder burns on the tan gabardine coat indicated that the revolver was held by the assassin almost against Taylor's body. Experiments in the police shooting gallery, where shots were fired at a similar piece of cloth from varying distances, confirmed the surmise that the muzzle of the revolver could not have been more than 4 inches from Taylor's coat when the fatal shot was fired. This discovery leads to two speculations. Number One: (Which is not considered seriously by the police,) is that Taylor killed himself. But no weapon was found by the body. The only conclusion reconcilable with this hypothesis is that the body was discovered by a burglar, who had entered the apartment and who was frightened away after picking up the revolver. Number Two: Taylor might have engaged in a desperate struggle with his assassin before he was killed, and that they were at death grips when the murderer pulled out his weapon and fired. This speculation is born out by the overturned chair found across the dead man's feet. But nothing else in the room had been disturbed however. If Taylor saw his slayer and grappled with him, it is believed that he must have recognized him as an enemy. This belief leads to the abandonment of the burglar theory and the concentration of every effort upon finding an ancient enemy of the murdered picture director--some one perhaps who knew him in the old days in New York, before he changed his name from Tanner to Taylor. ...Today's activities by the police followed a night of fruitless endeavor to solve the murder mystery by detectives and deputy sheriffs, outstanding in the night's work was the detention and grilling of two well- known movie actors. In overcoat and muffler, with a cap pulled down over his forehead, George Milo, picture actor, strode up and down the sidewalk last night in front of 404-B South Alvarado street, the bungalow home of Taylor. He was enacting, against his will, a role he had often played for profit in the films--that of a 'genteel heavy.' Eyes unseen by him looked out from the shuttered windows of the bungalow across the court from Taylor's. Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of the movie star, was comparing Milo with the man she saw leaving the bungalow where Taylor was murdered. Meanwhile, in a closed automobile, parked a short distance away deputy sheriffs were firing questions at Henri Reineque, actor and friend of Milo. The questions concerned his whereabouts and that of the other film actor last Wednesday night. Milo and Reineque were taken into custody at 8 o'clock last night as they were alighting from Milo's automobile in front of the Lobban apartments, 1030 West Eighth street, where both live. Al Manning, chief deputy in charge of criminal investigations at the sheriff's office, drove to the Lobban with Deputy Sheriff Harvey Bell. They had traced Milo's automobile after a mysterious telephone message had been received at the sheriff's office to the effect that a Maxwell sedan with a certain number stood in front of Taylor's home the night of the murder. The number given by the anonymous informant was that of Milo's closed Maxwell. 'The boss wants to see you,' explained Manning, accosting the men. 'Who's the boss?' asked one. 'The sheriff,' replied Bell. The two actors made no protest as they were escorted to the sheriff's automobile and taken to the office. Here they were separated and both subjected to a severe grilling on the question of their whereabouts Wednesday night. Milo at first seemed worried by the questions. 'You were a close acquaintance of Mabel Normand, weren't you?' demanded one of the five or six deputies who surrounded him with a circle of accusing eyes. 'No,' replied Milo. 'I worked with her in 'The Slim Princess.' Aside from that I know nothing about her.' One of the deputies later ran up and shook an accusing finger in Milo's face. 'Don't you know you are suspected of murdering William Taylor?' he shouted at Milo. The actor's face showed instant relief and he broke into a smile. Then he reached over and shook hands with his questioner. 'That's a good joke,' he said. 'You really had me frightened for a while. I didn't know what you wanted me for. But if that's it, why it's too ridiculous to do anything about except laugh.' The officers were not satisfied with this denial and bundled Milo into an automobile. He was taken to the South Alvarado street bungalow court, where he was dressed as the mysterious stranger was supposed to have been and made to promenade in front of the place. Meanwhile Reineque was being subjected to an equally severe fire of questions. 'Where were you Wednesday night?' iterated all of his questioners in chorus. 'For heaven's sake! Give a man time to think,' replied Reineque, scratching his head. He came from Alsace-Lorraine and speaks with a slight accent. Finally, after Mrs. Douglas MacLean had failed to recognize Milo as the muffled stranger whom she saw leaving Taylor's house and after continued questioning had failed to elicit anything of importance from either of the movie actors, they were driven home by the deputy sheriffs and dismissed with apologies for the inconvenience caused them. Both men were warned, however, that they were under surveillance and told not to leave town. Police Captain Adams and Detectives Cline, Cahill and Cato were with the deputy sheriffs and assisted at the investigation last night. Milo, a handsome chap of the movie leading man type, was still somewhat staggered by his experience of last night, when he was seen today. He was able to summon a smile, however, at what he characterized as the 'ridiculous charge that I killed Taylor.' His screen history in Los Angeles connects him as an actor with several prominent women stars with whom he has worked in various pictures. These include Pauline Frederick, Theda Bara, Clara Kimball Young, Ruth Roland and Mabel Normand. Milo today reiterated the statement he made to the officers that he only knew Miss Normand through working with her in one picture. The actor is of French birth, but has spent most of his life in America. Besides being an actor, he is an athlete of prowess. He formerly toured in vaudeville with an acrobatic act, in which he was 'understander' and also posed in a leopard skin to show his unusual muscular development. ...The disappearance of a frilly diaphanous article of feminine apparel, which Peavey said had reposed for months in a box in one of Taylor's dresser drawers, was another grain of mystery in the case today. The valet happened to remember about the missing garment and informed the police. It was in its usual place up to the night of the murder. Peavey said he did not know who the owner of the garment was or why Taylor kept it.
1922-02-06	...It was early Friday afternoon that Miss Minter came to view Desmond's body. She carried a dozen Black Prince roses intertwined with fern. As she saw the beloved form upon a couch she burst into tears and asked the friend who was with her to leave the room. The door closed behind him and for a few brief moments she was alone with Taylor. When Ivy H. Overholtzer, funeral director, opened the door a little later she was standing bowed over the body, her tears falling upon the gray silk robe in which it was clothed. Turning to the mantel upon which she had placed the roses she drew forth a single bud and laid it across Taylor's chest. Then, sobbing her grief, she left the room and was driven away in her car...
1922-02-06	On my word of honor, on my word of honor. Get it straight, please.' Mabel Normand emphasized that phrase all the time that she talked to me about William Desmond Taylor, the moving picture director who had been her friend and who was mysteriously murdered shortly after he had placed her in her auto Wednesday night. Miss Normand, nervous and shaken, heavy-lidded from loss of sleep and the grueling inquisition to which she has been subjected since the murder, came into her delightful sitting-room this morning and talked freely of her friendship with the dead man, and the rumors that since his death have arisen about him. 'I was never in love with Mr. Taylor in the way one means when they use the expression 'in love.' If he was in love with me, he never told me. 'There was no thought or talk of marriage between us. Our friendship was based on comradeship and understanding. In many ways he was wonderful. I loved to go out with him because he understood so well when my work forced me to break engagements, and because we loved so many of the same things, books, music, pictures.' 'Do you know any woman who might have been jealous of you, who might have loved Mr. Taylor?' I asked. 'On my word of honor, no,' she cried, beating her tiny hands together. 'Or any man who might have been jealous of the place that he occupied in your esteem?' Again the emphatic denial and the movement of the slender hands. 'It has been hinted that he had dope parties,' suggested another reporter. 'Did you ever hear of them?' 'Never, in God's world, never, on my word of honor. Billy was one of the cleanest and most temperate men in all his habits. He was sick, and very careful of his diet. He loved clean, simple pleasures, and he was a kind and thoughtful friend. 'Flowers? Yes, he sent them to me three times a week. He knew that I loved flowers. And--yes, he telegraphed me often when I was in New York, but not every night. His telegrams were sometimes about things he wanted me to get for him in New York, sometimes just efforts to keep me posted about things here. I bought golf balls for him and he looked after the welfare of my dog and often wired me that it was well. 'And, oh, please, say that I never heard of that pink nightgown, and that I always went to Mr. Taylor's dinners with a crowd.' 'Henry Peavey, the colored servant, said'-- 'He ought to be ashamed to say that I asked him about other girls going to Mr. Taylor's house,' Miss Normand burst out. 'Henry ought to be grateful to me. I saved him his job when Mr. Taylor wanted to fire him. I begged that Billy wouldn't fire him on a rumor which might be false. 'And say this, please, on my word of honor, I never spoke to Henry in my life except in Mr. Taylor's presence, and can you imagine my asking before Billy about other girls? Henry has told an awful big story. 'I hope they find my letters because they are just little messages about everyday things. I never did go to the house to search for them. I only went to show the police how the furniture had been arranged. 'I can't imagine anybody wanting to kill Billy. He was the kindest, most patient and tactful man I ever knew. I never knew him to lose his temper and, no, I never saw him show fear.' And so the little star rattled on, begging, explaining, replying to all questions with the utmost frankness and detail. 'She's worn out, poor little thing,' said A. McArthur, publicity manager for the Sennett studios. 'She wants to help clear up this mystery, but she needs rest terribly. We can't take her out of town. If we do everybody will say she ran away, and nobody will let her rest in town; the telephone goes every minute and the doorbell, too. 'The poor kid lost a friend when Taylor died, but she knows nothing about why or how he died. You can bet on that.'
1922-02-06	...There was some friction in the police probe of the slaying today and it was reported that certain detectives had asked to be given other assignments rather than continue investigating the murder with asserted misunderstanding existing. Several detectives were inclined to the theory that the person who slew Taylor may have been mentally unbalanced, and qualified their remarks regarding that phase of the probe by discussing confidential reports obtained today from the mystery witness who called at detective headquarters and who was said to have stated he saw Sands near the scene of the slaying late Wednesday night. A clew regarding what became of the letters and telegrams said to have been in Taylor's dresser drawer, written by Mabel Normand, film actress and friend of the slain director, was given to the police today while the slaying was being investigated from the hour Taylor's dead body was found. Investigation was made of a report that after Taylor's death Miss Normand's letters were taken away by a visitor to the house. Considerable time was devoted to reviewing the occurrences at Taylor's residence following the finding of the body by Henry Peavey, negro valet- cook. It was pointed out that when aid for Detective Sergeant Tom Zeigler reached the bungalow court, fully a half hour after the report was received that Taylor had presumably died of natural causes, the house was virtually filled with strangers to the detectives who may have disturbed important evidence. The detectives who clung to the belief that Taylor was shot and killed in a 'love triangle' by a vengeance-seeking lover, or by a hired assassin, continued to direct their investigation today into the realms of stardom and several of the leading actors and actresses were questioned regarding the slain director's recent activities, his intimates, his asserted affairs of the heart and the source from which he obtained select liquors. Detectives Theodore Mailheau and Lloyd Yarrow, members of the police narcotic squad, investigated reports that Taylor was a close friend of several film luminaries said to be addicted to the use of narcotics. Taylor was not a drug addict, say the police, but may have had knowledge of drug peddlers supplying the alleged addicts...
1922-02-06	Another interesting picture of the past life of the slain director was revealed today by Miss Neva Gerber, film actress, who was at one time engaged to marry Taylor. Miss Gerber declared that she had seen Taylor wrapped in spells of utter despondency on many occasions and that on several of these period he had expressed a wish to 'end it all.' She said that Taylor often complained of ill health, declaring that he could not eat anything, and that he was usually most despondent when he had just completed a picture upon which he had been working extremely hard.
1922-02-06	POLICE HOLD ACTOR IN FILM DEATH SIFT   Detain Cameraman Also for Questioning.   DRUG PEDDLER SOUGHT   Woman's Night Dress Figures in New Developments.   LATE CLEW HELD STRONGEST   Drug Peddler sought. Search for a drug peddler, upon whose trail the police said they were "getting warmer," and a woman's silken nightdress, said by Henry Peavey, colored houseman, to be missing from the apartments of William D. Taylor, slain film director, were the outstanding developments here tonight of the search for his slayer. The police were reticent as to the details concerning their search for the man, a peddler who was believed to have sought patrons for his contraband drugs among the employes of motion picture studios, but they intimated their belief he had attempted to make a delivery through Taylor to an actress who found it difficult to make her purchases in person.   The exact importance of the missing nightdress, which was pink, was not made plain. Peavey, however. was firm in his declaration that it had a regular place in Taylor's apartments and equally firm in his assertions that since his employer was slain he had been unable to find it.   Arrest Expected Soon. After the announcement of the search for the drug peddler, deputy  sheriffs left for an unnamed destination on what they termed the "most definit clew thus far discovered in the Taylor murder mystery." They  said they were going to interview "a certain party" and possibly make an arrest. This was the first active participation of the sheriffs forces in the case. The search for Edward F. Sands, missing butler of William D. Taylor, motion picture director, who was mysteriously murdered last Wednesday night, continued to be an important element of the investigation of Tayfor 's death, police said today.   Valet questioned Again. Henry Peavey, valet of Taylor, who found his employers body, eame to police headquarters again today and was questioned by detectives for  CONTINUED ON THIRD PAGE   POLICE HOLD ACTOR IN FILM DEATH SIFT   CONTINUED FROM FIRST PAGE. half hour.  It is understood he was asked for more detailed information concerning the arrangement of Tayor's furniture and other belongings in the apartments. Two other men whose names were not divulged, also were questioned at police headquarters. One of these men departed with detectives, who said merely they were going to check up on an angle of the case that had been previously investigated. The whereabouts of letters which Miss Mabel Normand, motion picture actdress, said she had written to Taylor, and which she said were missing from his apartments, continued to be an matter of suspicion today. It is believed that these letters and other papers could have been removed last Thursday morning, some time during the period when Taylor 's house was unguarded, while it was believed he ad died of natural causes. Miss Normand said she had seen the letters in the apartment a few days before the murder, and knew no reason way anyone should want them.   Other Clews Secret. A. L. Manning, head of the criminal investigation department of the sheriff's office, and several deputies were absent most of the day on a mission connected with the slaying. upon his return Manning said there had been certain developments he could not disclose at that time. His investigation today, he added, did not relates in any way to Sands. The district attorneys office also had men assigned to the case, working jointly with the police detective force.   Revenge, prompted by jealousy, remained apparently the most probable  motive for the alleged crime, investigators of the various departmentso  generally agreed. The possibility that the slayer was a frustrated blackmailer also was being considered. There was declared further to  be a mere chance that he was a burglar, surprised by Taylor, who fled after the shooting without attempting to remove any valuables.   Believe Slayer was Man. Capt. of Detectives David P. Adams, who is directing the police investigation, said everything in the case indicated that the slayer was a man. Whether the fact that Taylor had changed his name from William Cunningham Deane Tanner, by which he  was known in New York fourteen years ago had any bearing upon the case, had not been determined today according to the police. Investigators expressed themselves as at a loss to account for the disaprearance of Miss Normands letters. They declared, however, that they did not believe the letters would throw any light on the case. The "main issue" so far, one investigator said, was the whereabouts of the missing Valet, Sands, for a few days before the shooting.
1922-02-06	Actress Divorced Husband Said to Have Made Threats   Special to The Washington post. Loss Angeles, Calif., Feb. 5.-Adding new complications to the murder mystery which has stunned the motion picture world was the informa tion given to the police today that the divorced husband of a beautiful Hollywood screen actress might be able to aid in solving the mystery of who shot and killed William D. Taylor, noted film director and soldier of fortune, last Wednesday. This actress and Mr. Taylor, it was said, were very close friends and   were seen together frequently, but it was denied that there was an affair of the heart.  The husband, accord ing to the story told the police, was wildly jealous of his wife and quar rels over her association with certain well-known actors and actresses are said to have precipitated a divorce  action, the wife getting the decree several months ago.  At that time he is reported to have made threats, not only involving Mr. Taylor, but others in Hollywood. A search is now being made for this man, who has mysteriously dis  appeared.  A prominent motion picture actor who has been placed under surveilance until his movements before and after the crime can be thoroughly checked, is said to be a friend of his divorcee who was a friend of Taylor. Coincident with the uncovering this new clew, it was revealed that another name was used by Mr. Today as Melbourne McDowell, husband of the late Fanny Davenport, was looking over an old scrapbook, he came across the name of Cunningham Deane, whom he has often met many times since as William Desmond Taylor. When the Fanny Davenport company played in New York in 1894, according to Mr. McDowell, there was a handsome young Englishman playing one of the minor parts. The cast of characters showed that the actor who played Stradella, a noble in the play, was Cunningham Deane. Later in Boston and on tour all over the country during the years 189495-96, Cunningham Deane belonged to any Davenport casts.   Favorite with Players. "We all liked Deane," said Mr. McDowell. "He was a gentle young chap and a favorite in the company. I recognized him here, but he sort off fooled me at first, for the name of Taylor threw me off the track. Mr. Taylor was a great man. He was a soldier of fortune, but he won his  spurs. We all deeply regret his untimely end." According to Mr. McDowell, Mr. Taylor, who was said to be 45 years  old, must have been 52 at the time of his death. The new developments in the slaying enigma have tended to lessen suspicion against Edward F Sands, Mr. Taylor 's former valet, who openly boasted that he was going to "get" the film director. It was pointed out that while Sands robbed his employer of valuable gems and pawned them in Fresno and Sacramento, his actions  against his employer were for personal gain and it is not believed possible that a woman figured in his actions.
1922-02-06	QUESTION AN ACTOR AND CAMERA MAN  IN TAYLOR MURDER After Two-Hour Examination in County Jail They Are Both Released OTHER CLUES FOLLOWED One Leads to a Drug Peddler who, it is Thought, Sold to Actress Through Taylor. MISSING EVIDENCE SOUGHT Some Clothing and Letters to Slain Man From Actress have Disappeared From His Home. LOS ANGELES, Feb. 5.-A motion picture actor and a camera man were brought to the Los Angeles County Jail here tonight for questioning as to their possible knowledge of clues to the murder of William Desmond Taylor, film director. After a two-hour examination they were released. Their names were not made public. The make-up was still on the actor's face when he arrived at the jail indicating, officers stated, that the Deputy Sheriffs who had brought him in, Al Manning, chief criminal deputy, and Harvey Bell, were in great haste to learn his story. The men were located at a motionpicture studio in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles, it was stated. After they had been questioned separately for two hours, the officers started back to Hollywood with the actor to give him an opportunity to make good his declaration to the deputies that he could account for his movements last Wednesday night, the night Taylor was slain. Apparently he did so for the release followed. Another angle was the story told by an associate of the dead director that a former employe had been heard to exclaim, when he heard of the slaying: "Bill Taylor got only what he deserved." The investigation showed, the police said, that this man had been employed by the Famous Players-Lasky concern. working under Taylor, in a minor capacity. One day he was drunk when he went on duty. Taylor ordered him removed from the place. The next day the man returned, only to find an order from Taylor that he should not be admitted. The police say they had begun a search for him. The Day's Other Clues. Search for a drug peddler, upon whose trail the police said they were "getting warmer," and the absence of a woman's silken night dress, said by Henry Peavey, colored houseman, to be missing from the apartments of Taylor, the other developments here tonight of the search for his slayer. The police were reticent as to the details concerning their search for the man, a peddler who was believed to have sought patrons for his contraband drugs among the employes of motion picture studios, but they intimated their belief he had attempted to make a delivery through Taylor to an actress who found it difficult to make her purchases in person. This was the first active participation of the Sherifff's forces in the case. The exact importance of the missing night dress, which was pink, was not made plain. Peavey, however, was firm in his declaration that it had a regular place in Taylor's apartments, and equally firm in his assertions that since his employer was slain he had been unable to find it. Letters Are Also Missing. The whereabouts of letters which Miss Mabel Normand, motion picture actress, said she had written to Taylor and which she said were missing from his apartments continued to be a matter of suspicion today. It is believed that these letters and other papers could have been removed last Thursday morning some time during the period when Taylor's house was unguarded, while it was believed he had died of natural causes. Miss Normand said she had seen the letters in the apartment a few days before the murder, and knew no reason why any one should want them. She said she would be willing to publish anything they contained. Investigators expressed themselves as at a loss to account for the disappearance of Miss Normand's letters. They declared, however, that they did mot believe the letters would throw any light on the case, The "main issue" so far, one investigator said, was the whereabouts of the missing valet Sands for a few days before the shooting. The search for Sands continued today. Checking of the various angles of the case among members of the motion picture colony and other friends and acquaintances of Taylor almost invariably led to some mention of Sands's name, according to detectives. Police said they had had several clues to Sands's whereabouts, but that these had resulted in disappointments. Two other men besides Peavey, the negro servant, whose names were not divulged, were also questioned at Police Headquarters. One of these men departed with detectives, who said that they were merely going to check up on an angle of the case that had been previously investigated. Tells of Feeling Toward Sands. Tending to show the alleged feeling of Taylor toward Edward F. Sands, or Edward Fitz Strathmore, his former butler, whom the director had charged with a felony, was a further statement today by Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored houseman. "Not long ago," says Peavey, "I was showing Mr. Taylor a coat I had bought.'That looks like one Sands stole from me, he said.'Oh, if I could only get my hands on that fellow.'" Melbourne MacDowell, actor, husband of the late Fannie Davenport, looked over an old scrapbook today and then gave to the press his belief that Taylor, under the name of Cunningham Deane,  played with the Fannie Davenport company at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in  New York in 1894, and later in Boston and during a tour of the country in 1895 and 1896. Taylor's body, dressed in the uniform of a British officer he wore in the World War, was viewed today by many friends and others at an undertaking establishment, where it will lie until the funeral services Tuesday at St. Paul's Episcopal Pro-Cathedral. Many flowers were sent there, to await transfer after the services, to the cemetery vault, where the body will be held until the arrivel of the Director's daughter, who has been in school in Mamaroneck, N. Y. Pallbearers will be William C. De Mille, Frank Seal, George Melford, Arthur Hoyt, James Young, Frank Lloyd, David Hartford and Charles Eyton, all widely known in motion pictures. Members of the British Overseas Club will attend the funeral in a body and a squad of former Canadian soldiers will fire a salute over the casket. Lester Wing, a Chinese, former chauffeur for Taylor, said today that the director once told him: " I never really loved but one woman. She was my stage partner. I was engaged to her, but she died before we could be married-and all never marry another woman." Engaged to Neva Gerber. The only woman whom Taylor called upon often during Wings service with him was Neva Gerber, film actress, who said here Friday she and Taylor had once been engaged to be marrled. But, while he and Miss Gerber were together two or three times a week, according to Wing, Taylor passed most of his time alone. Winifred Kingston, film actress, characterized tonight as " ridiculous," the report she had been engaged to marry Taylor, a rumor that spread after it was discovered that the only framed photograph found in the director's apartment was one of her. Miss Kingston and Taylor had been acquainted, she said, a fact she attributed to their both being of British birth. She said he told her something of his domestic affairs. I also learned something of Sands, the Butler," said Miss Kingston. "When Edward Knoblock was living at Mr. Taylor's home, Sands, at various times, bought a considerable amount of lingerie, which, I understand, he gave to a young girl a very young creature in whom he was interested and who lived at home with her mother. All of this he charged to Mr: Taylor's account at a Los Angeles department store, he was told. This naturally enraged the director when he returned from abroad. On day, to show his affection and regard for Mr. Taylor, Sands drew up a contract stating he would be the director's servant for life, would always be his slave. I don't know what happened to the document, but I do know Mr. Taylor laughed about it. The search through the director's belongings today brought forth messages and notes from many film actresses, including Blanche Sweet and Glorla Swanson. Whether the fact that Taylor had changed his name from William Cunningham Deane-Tanner, by which he was known in New York fourteen years ago, had any bearing upon the case had not been determined today, according to the police. JUNEAU, Alaska, Feb. 5.-William Desmond Taylor, motion-picture director slain at Los Angeles, played in his own stock company at Fairbanks, Skagway and other Alaska towns during the Winter of 1909, according to residents here. He once was interested in mining ventures near Dawson and in the Klondike district. Knew Taylor as Deane-Tanner. Several persons in New York who knew William Desmond Taylor as Deane-Tanner, a dealer in antiques, before he abandoned his wife and child in 1908, had been aware for some time before his death that the two men were the same. They had seen him when he was acting in moving pictures, and some of his former friends wrote to him, but without receiving a reply. Frank I. Sparrell of Westfield, N. J., was one of those who had been associated in business with Deane-Tanner in New York, and who recognized him years after his disappearance as Taylor, the moving picture actor and later the  director. He was known as "Pete" Deane-Tanner to Sparrell and other men who were with A. J. Crawford in an antique shop in Fifth Avenue. DeaneTanner's brother Dennis, who disappeared four years after William went away, also worked for Crawford. "After being with the firm a couple of years Dennis left to go with Vernay," said Mr. Sparrell. "'Pete' was considering going with Vernay, but changed his mind and stayed with Crawford. "We all knew and liked'Pete,' who was President of the concern. I noticed as we all did the spells of terrible facial neuralgia, which he had at various times, and also lapses of memory. I saw him before he went to the races in October, 1908, and he seemed to be all right. At that time Mr. Crawford was  in Europe, and Deane-Tanner was running the business. When he didn't show up we all thought it was strange, and I  went to call on his wife at their home in Larchmont. She was considerably broken up about his disappearance, and had not heard from him since he left his home to go to the office and later to the races. "Pete" was a very reserved, cultured, quiet chap: not a heavy drinker, although he was a member of clubs where the members drank occasionally. His home life, as I had seen it many times, was most happy with his wife and little girl. "The appearance of'Pete' as the Mexican hero-horseman in'Captain Alvarez,' was the first intimation we had that he was alive. Some of his intimate friends wrote to him, but so far as I know, he never answered their letters. I have never seen him since he disappeared. "His business affairs were in excellent condition when he left. He had a comfortable, though not an elaborate home, and he was getting a salary of $10,000, which was considerable in those days. We all believe with his former wife, that he was suffering from some delusion or loss of memory when he disappeared. He was one of the finest men I have ever known." The principal link between Mabel Normand and Taylor was a liking for books, according to P. M. Asher, representative of Miss Normand's company, who recently returned from California. Taylor was looked upon in the colony as a man of unusual scholarship and knowledge of art and literature, Mr. Asher said, and he stood out in this respect so greatly that his advice was always sought on matters in which his general knowledge made him unusually useful. Miss Normand had learned much from him, and read many books which Taylor suggested, Mr. Asher declared. Taylor was seldom seen in the usual haunts of the moving-picture people of the colony, he said, and never in those of the gayer set. He kept much to himself, although he had many friends.  
1922-02-06	Anxious to Hide "Blessed Baby" Letters to Taylor   Special to The Washington Post. Los Angeles, Feb. 6.-"I sought those letters and hoped to get them before they reached the scrutiny of others. I admit this, but it was for only one purpose, to prevent their terms of affection being misconstrued. "Just in a jest, Mr. Taylor called me "blessed baby." It started at dinner parties we attended together, and just to tease him I called him-this great big. stern-minded man-'Baby,' in return. These terms were used in our letters strictly in fun and I fear, will be misunderstood." This is the reason Mabel Normand, film star, gave tonight that she sought so earnestly the missives exchanged between her and the slain motion picture director, William Desmond Taylor, after the inquest Saturday.
1922-02-06	Taylor Said to Have Been Timekeeper for Gold Firm.   Santa Barbara, Calif., Feb. 5.-During most of the period between the disappearance of William Desmond Taylor from New York in 1908 and the time he entered the employment of a motion picture company in Los Angeles in 1912, he was working as time keeper for the Yuken Gold Company in Yukon territory, according to George Morrison, city engineer. Morrison said Taylor went to San Francisco from New York early in 1909 and from there was sent to the Yukon. He remained there until some time in 1912, according to Morrison, who was hydraulic engineer for the company during that time. He then went under the name of William Desmond Taylor, but he told Morrison, of whom he made a confidant, that that was not his real name. He also told Morrison, according to the letter, that he left New York because of an overwhelming burden of debt. Contracted while he was an art dealer there. Mrs. Potter Palmer. Chicago society leader, now dead, was his personal backer, he told Morrison. Juneau, Alaska, Feb. 5.-William Desmond Taylor, motion picture director slain at Los Angeles, played in his own stock company at Fairbanks. Skagway and other Alaska towns during the winter of 1909, according to residents here. He once was interrested in mining ventures near Dawson and in the Klondike district.
1922-02-07	Located by the EXAMINER late last night and questioned until midnight by Deputy Sheriff Harvey Bell and George Pross, manager of the Burns Detective Agency, the wealthy young New Yorker, who had been engaged to a motion picture star frequently mentioned in connection with the William D. Taylor murder mystery, gave an account of himself, which, in the opinion of the officers, practically eliminates him from consideration. The examination of the young man occurred in a downtown hotel and was of special interest because of his close attentions to two of the actresses most conspicuous in the social life of Taylor. He was able, state the officers, to account for every hour of his time on the night of the murder. Interest had centered in this picturesque character for several days, largely because he was known as the rejected suitor of the star who, herself, was said to be infatuated with Taylor. Police and sheriff's officers were instructed to find this man, who had checked out from the fashionable hotel where he was a guest on Wednesday afternoon and, apparently, had disappeared. Information coming to THE EXAMINER late yesterday afternoon enabled one of its representatives to locate him. He was found in his room at a downtown hotel and his interrogation followed. His elimination is regarded by the police as one of the most important contributions to the case in that it removes a possibility which had engaged the efforts of several officers, and thus narrows the field in which investigation must be prosecuted.
1922-02-07	If Peavey, his colored servant, says that I had asked him about any girls that Mr. Taylor had ever been interested in, it is a venomous fabrication. Never in my life have I spoken to this man directly, and never have I talked to him in any way except in the presence of others, including Mr. Taylor. And as for the subject of girls--the question never entered my mind.' [5]
1922-02-07	...The visit of Mr. Eyton to the Detective Bureau was for the purpose of aiding in the search for Sands. Several witnesses who know the fugitive say they saw him in Los Angeles about the time of the shooting. At least two persons believe they saw him on the night of the shooting. One woman saw Sands within a block of the Taylor home within less than two hours of the time set for the murder. Capt. Adams in a statement to newspaper men declared that the entire case hinges on Sands. 'If we can locate Sands,' declared Capt. Adams, 'then we will be able once and for all to settle the question of his whereabouts on the night of the murder. If Sands cannot prove to our satisfaction where he was on Wednesday night between 7 and 8 o'clock we will then believe that we have found the right man.' ...Several women and three men, all of whom know Sands by sight, say that they saw him on the streets of the city during the last month. ...Police say Sands has lost some weight since he fled after the first robbery.
1922-02-07	Julia Crawford Ivers, scenarist for the late William D. Taylor, yesterday gave out the following statement: 'Today the friends of William D. Taylor, and they are legion, will gather to pay the last tribute to the man they love, to one who as man, director and friend measured 100 per cent. 'I have worked side by side with this man for seven years. We have solved many difficult problems together, sometimes pleasant, sometimes unpleasant: always hard, trying nerve-wracking. And during all these years of close association I have never known him to do one unkind, one ungenerous act, but I have known hundreds of instances of open-handed generosity and in most cases the beneficiary never knew whom to thank. 'This man whose loyalty and honor were without question, who takes with him the undying gratitude of the thousands to whom he has lent a helping hand--this man who stood for everything that was fine and clean in pictures, who is known to have declared that if it were necessary to his success to produce unclean pictures he would go back to the white, clean snows of Alaska and dig his living out of the ground--this man was shot in the back by a cowardly assassin. He was given no opportunity to defend himself and William D. Taylor would have defended himself, for he did not know the meaning of the word fear. And more cowardly than the assassin's bullet, lodged in the heart of this dear man, is the tongue of scandal, which safely sheltered behind his dead body, is striking at his reputation--more cowardly for he is powerless to defend himself. 'His friends know that when it is all over the character of Mr. Taylor will stand, as it always has stood, for everything that is fine and worth while. 'The good book says, 'Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.' And it is recorded that no stones were cast.'
1922-02-07	...Dr. H. M. S. Maddock, who was the examining physician for the Canadian recruiting mission throughout the period of the war, and who is a Los Angeles resident, examined William Desmond Taylor for Canadian [British] army service. Facts obtained from Dr. Maddock concerning William Desmond Taylor's enlistment coincide with the records of W. D. Taylor found in the London War Office. The London dispatch states the enlistment of W. D. Taylor of 1127 Orange Street, Los Angeles, was attested to in Chicago, July 3, 1918. Dr. Maddock, though he does not remember the date, stated last night that it was a very hot day in July, 1918, when William Desmond Taylor entered the recruiting office in the San Fernando Building for his medical examination. 'I remember the man well,' he said. 'I did not usually examine personally, the recruits. Most of them were ordinary men, such as we see daily on the streets, many shabbily dressed. Mr. Taylor was different from the ordinary man, so I examined him personally. He was a man of fine physique for his age, one of the best physical specimens I had yet seen. 'Mr. Taylor, as was the rule, was then sent to San Francisco for a second examination. He did not accompany the other recruits, whose railroad fare was always paid by the recruiting mission. He paid his own fare to San Francisco and went alone. No one had accompanied him to the Los Angeles recruiting office on the day of his enlistment. He was alone. 'The war record shows he was entered into the service at Chicago on July 3, 1918, I am told. That is not unusual for the recruits, after passing examinations at San Francisco, were sent either to Vancouver or to Chicago for their final medical examinations. At the place where this third medical examination is passed, the recruit is then taken into the service. I think Mr. Taylor went to Chicago.'
1922-02-07	...William Desmond Taylor was never an officer attached to the 5th battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, according to the official record of the fusiliers, who are now stationed at Hounslow barracks, London, where the adjutant searched through forty-six thousand names of officers and men of the regiment participating in the World War. ...[Taylor] arrived at Hounslow barracks December 2, 1918, coming in a draft of 500 Britishers who had enlisted in America...On December 5, 1918, he was transferred to the Army Service Corps at the Expeditionary Force Canteen on Victoria Street, London.
1922-02-07	A gracious tribute to the memory of William D. Taylor, murdered director, was paid yesterday, in an interview by Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. 'The most patient man I ever knew,' Mrs. Fairbanks said, and her husband added. 'We all knew him as a gentleman of whom the film industry might well be proud.' 'We were horribly shocked,' Mrs. Fairbanks said, 'to learn of his death and we simply refuse to believe the innuendos against his character. Neither of us were intimate friends of his, but he had directed me and we naturally were well acquainted. 'Both as a gentleman and as an artist I respected him. 'He was ever courteous, considerate, and above all, patient. It's pretty hard directing all sorts of people in big pictures, members of the casts often being temperamental and even stubborn. He never had a harsh word to say to anyone and would spend all sorts of time and energy to get just the artistic results he wanted. 'To me and to everyone who ever mentioned him to me, he was always the quiet, reserved, artistic gentleman. The films could not have lost a more valuable or more beloved member and I cannot deplore too much the fact of the tragedy or the attendant notoriety. 'We are hardly ever out and have our own small circle of friends, and so about his private life we know nothing. But it seems a shame that these girls should have to be linked up with such a ghastly crime. Although I know none of them well, I have always heard of them as nice, well thought of citizens.' To this statement Douglas Fairbanks added only that he had met Taylor a few times and though not an intimate of his, knew of him as a man of the highest caliber and a man who was ever trying to make of the films something finer and better.
1922-02-07	In order to refute the statement by wire from her aunt, Mrs. John Ketcham of Buffalo, N. Y., Mrs. Ada Deane-Tanner of Monrovia, divorced wife of Dennis Deane-Tanner, stated in detail yesterday numerous points and occurrences which preclude the possibility of William Deane-Tanner and Dennis Deane-Tanner being one and the same man. 'It was just a few days after the birth of my first little daughter, Muriel, in 1908, that I first saw William Deane-Tanner, my husband's brother. He came out to see his new niece and while there was a resemblance in the two men it was not so striking that they could have been taken for each other under any circumstances. My husband was about five feet nine inches in height while his brother was over six feet tall and the brother wore a mustache at that time and my husband was smooth shaven. My husband had had his nose broken while at college when engaging in strenuous athletic sports and this gave his face an identity that could not be mistaken. 'William Deane-Tanner disappeared about a year after I saw him and my husband grieved terribly over the strange occurrence and missed his brother very much. I went to see his wife at the time. She was a very beautiful blonde with light golden hair and the most perfect skin and very slender. She seemed perfectly dazed with wonder as to why he had left her. 'I was married in 1907 and for five years my husband was everything that the most exacting or the most idealistic wife could demand or desire. He was tender, thoughtful, generous, patient, clean-minded and the soul of honor. Suddenly I was taken ill and the doctor said I must be sent to California. This distressed my husband so that we decided to try the Adirondacks first to see if the mountain air there would not bring me back to health and strength. So my husband helped me pack, looked after every arrangement for the trip and took me and our two little children up to a comfortable, picturesque house in the mountains and then went back to his business. in a few days I got a big express package with some heavier flannels for me and an immense box of candy, all tied up with fancy ribbons. 'William Deane-Tanner was called 'Petie' by his intimate associates in New York. I do not know who gave him the name and I do not think the brothers saw each other often. My husband did not come out with his brother when he came to see me as he was at his place of business and could not leave. But there was no possibility of their being the same man. 'That was the last communication I ever received from my husband. He never wrote a line to me after leaving me there and I never saw him again. This was nearly four years after the disappearance of his brother. After his brother left, his mother and sister, in London, with whom I corresponded, often wrote of how they were grieving over William's strange dropping from sight. His mother said she was sure he must be dead or that she would hear from him. When my husband disappeared and I wrote them they never answered my letters and though I wrote a number of times I have never heard from them again and lost track of them. 'It is true that my husband had the same fits of despondency that William is said to have had. He would have depressed, gloomy spells that I could neither account for nor make him shake off. He rarely spoke of his people in England, but I merely attributed that to the characteristic reticence of the English to discuss their affairs and I never had any reason to suspect that there was any tragedy or skeleton in the family that he was hiding. 'The only other time I ever saw William Deane-Tanner was when I went to ask him if he had ever seen or heard from my husband. He was so very stern and repelling and acted so like a man of stone that I was chilled and hurt, but I wrote to him and told him the reasons and proof by which I knew he was the man I claimed him to be. It was after that that he began sending me the allowance. The way I came to hear of him being out here friends of mine in New York saw him on the screen and recognized his face and learned that he was now a director at Lasky's. 'His sister's name was Mrs. Eaudel-Phillips and I gathered that they were people of independent means though not extremely wealthy. Both my husband and his brother were educated at Clifton and were then sent to Germany and France to finish their education and my husband spoke both French and German fluently.' Mrs. Deane-Tanner spoke of little mannerisms that the brothers had in common, such as holding a cigarette in a peculiar way, and of tossing the head back. She said that in disposition and temperament, in education, tastes and habits they were much the same, and she stated that although her husband saw but little of his brother, he was very deeply attached to him, and that after the brother's disappearance her husband grew more and more moody.
1922-02-07	Mrs. Ada Deane-Tanner...declared here today... 'I would like to correct published statements about my husband, Dennis. He never associated with other women. 'I feel confident that if Dennis is alive his existence could not possibly have any connection with the murder. The brothers were very much devoted to each other.'
1922-02-07	A chauffeur employed by the Yellow Taxicab Company last night gave officers investigating the murder of William Desmond Taylor, slain film director, what was regarded as one of the hottest leads thus far uncovered in the attempts to solve the mystery of the fatal shooting last Wednesday night. This chauffeur, who was taken in tow at once by Detective Sergeants King, Cato and Cahill, is named Meister and is reported to have taken a party from the vicinity of the shooting soon after the slaying. He was accompanied on his trip to the detective bureau by Sidney Glover, an official of the taxicab company. Captain of Detective Adams declined to discuss the new phase of the case. Earlier in the day he talked with the two new witnesses. They were not to be found last night, and were declared to be with the two detective sergeants. Several new angles in the investigation were opened up yesterday by deputy sheriffs working under the personal direction of Sheriff Traeger, Undersheriff Biscailuz and Criminal Superintendent Al Manning. While Mr. Manning refused to disclose what lines the Sheriff's investigation is taken, he admitted his officers, Deputies Harvey Bell and Fox and Nolan, were following leads that have developed new aspects of the murder mystery. 'I cannot state at this time what we are working on, but the information uncovered by this office is very significant and is vital to the solution of the crime,' Mr. Manning said late last night. Centering their efforts on finding Edward F. Sands, suspect in the investigation of the murder, detectives on the case yesterday followed several clews while Captain of Detective Adams held secret conferences with at least four important witnesses... Twice during the day all the detectives working on the case were called together in conference with Capt. Adams. They all declared they are concentrating their efforts toward finding Sands, the former employee of Mr. Taylor and an asserted robber and forger for whose arrest Mr. Taylor swore out a warrant. Few definite concrete developments were noticeable as a result of the day's activities. Further facts concerning the past and mysterious life of the slain man were uncovered. Many supposed clews were checked by the officers and found valueless. Charles Eyton, manager for the Famous Players-Lasky studio, where Mr. Taylor, a director of international reputation, was under contract, held a long talk with Capt. Adams. Henry Peavey, negro houseman who discovered the body of his employer, also was a visitor at the police station. Late in the day it was declared by the officers that missing letters known to have been kept by Mr. Taylor shortly before his death have an important bearing, in their belief, on the case. Among these letters were several written by Mabel Normand, film star, to Mr. Taylor. Everyone questioned by Capt. Adams concerning the letters has denied having them or removing them from the Taylor apartment on South Alvarado street, where his body was found last Thursday morning. Mr. Eyton, who was one of the first outsiders called to the scene, again yesterday said he had not seen them. Miss Normand last Saturday called at the house for her letters. She has not seen those which she wrote. Public Administrator Bryson, who has charge of the estate, says he has not seen them. The District Attorney's Office makes similar avowal. The visit of Mr. Eyton to the Detective Bureau was for the purpose of aiding in the search for Sands. Several witnesses who know the fugitive say they saw him in Los Angeles about the time of the shooting. At least two persons believe they saw him on the night of the shooting. One woman saw Sands within a block of the Taylor home within less than two hours of the time set for the murder... The investigation has simmered down to a process of elimination, with the finding of Sands as the first obstacle. Hundreds of theories, tips and clews have been investigated, weighed and discarded or added to the chain of circumstances being assembled by the detectives. During the day, representatives of Mabel Normand, who was the last friend who saw Mr. Taylor alive last Wednesday, called at the police station to tell the detectives that Miss Normand was going to have her telephone number changed to avoid the continual stream of calls made for her recently. The pink silk nightgown--a delicate, lacy piece of woman's lingerie-- that was found in the bachelor apartments of the slain man yesterday held attention of many persons. The garment was one of several formerly at the house, according to the statement of a former employee, and was there during the six months Peavey worked there. Employees preceding Peavey declared that the silken things so strange to a man's wardrobe were used occasionally, or at least were taken from their accustomed places, unfolded and replaced. Reports were circulated during the day that the owner of the night dress had been identified as an actress friend of the dead man. No official confirmation of this could be obtained. The garment, known to have been at the home on the morning the body was found, was not available for public scrutiny. The comment made by Mr. Eyton regarding the missing letters was as follows: 'I have taken no letters from Mr. Taylor's home the day the body was found, nor have I taken any, or had any letters given me by anyone since. There were a number of papers and documents there. I watched the representative of the Public Administrator's office sort the papers. It was more than a half-hour after the body was found that I arrived there. In the meantime scores of persons went through the house.' Mr. Eyton joined Capt. Adams and Public Administrator Bryson in the opinion that if any of Mabel Normand's letters were taken away from the Taylor home, they were taken by the man who killed Taylor or by some friend of Miss Normand who wanted to return them to the comedy star. 'I have no interest in any of these letters,' Mr. Eyton continued. 'If I had them I would turn them over to the police, because I am interested only in one thing, and that is the capture of the man who murdered 'Bill' Taylor, my friend. I hardly think, however, that there was anything in the missing letters that would be of any assistance in the search for the slayer.'... Several women and three men, all of whom knew Sands by sight, say that they saw him on the streets of the city during the last month. None of them spoke to him and several of them under close questioning by the police admit that they may have been mistaken...
1922-02-07	When William Desmond Taylor, noted film director, was shot to death in his South Alvarado street apartment last Wednesday night, he was standing with his arms lifted over his head and a .38-caliber revolver pressed against his side, some six inches below his left armpit and toward the back. Such is the new theory of the police advanced yesterday for the first time. They base their belief on a careful examination made yesterday of the clothing worn by the noted motion picture man when he fell, mortally wounded, to the floor of his living-room, about 8 o'clock Wednesday night. In a conference of the detectives working on the case, including Police Detective King of the District Attorney's office as well as the officers detailed from the detective bureau, a minute inspection of the garments was made. The hole through which the bullet entered was powder-marked. The marking was of such a nature that they decided conclusively he was shot by a revolver held pressed against his coat. By comparing the entrance of the bullet in the coat, and in the vest, a remarkable new fact was disclosed. The holes do not correspond in location when the coat is adjusted normally about the wearer. But when the arm was raised the hole in the coat was brought up to the corresponding hole in the vest. This fact led to the definite conclusion of the investigators that when Mr. Taylor was shot down he knew he was being attacked, that he was compelled to hold his arms overhead by the assailant. The discovery of the new-found facts did not change the police theory that the slayer slipped into the house by the front door while Mr. Taylor was absent for a few minutes. At that time he was escorting Miss Mabel Normand, celebrated film actress, to her automobile, after she had made a short call for the purpose of getting a book. During the temporary absence of Mr. Taylor, the assassin stepped quickly into the house and crouched behind the door, the police believe. From this position he had the drop on the film director when the latter re-entered and closed the door. That he ordered Mr. Taylor to put up his hands is now the belief of the officers. And while the victim was standing in this position he was shot to death, probably after a conversation, if the slaying was done for revenge. Some of the officers believe the shot could have made the same entrance holes in the coat and vest if Mr. Taylor was bending over to seize a chair at his writing desk in order to defend himself against the intruder. To support this belief they point to the overturned chair found in the apartment--the only suspicion that an attempted struggle was staged. To verify the belief the revolver was pressed against the coat when fired, Detective King took some of the clothing and experimented with shots fired from various distances. This confirmed the theory, he said. The piece of lead which penetrated Mr. Taylor's lung and all but went completely through his body was positively identified as having been fired from a .38-caliber, short, soft-nosed cartridge. This type of shell is commonly used, although it will not fit an automatic weapon.
1922-02-07	In William D. Taylor's effects two love letters, written in a school- girl code, were found. One of them is reproduced above. It is a code familiar to thousands of youngsters. The letter reads as follows. 'I love you--oh, I love you so. 'I had to come down because mama remarked that I always seemed to feel rather happy after being out with you. So here I am. Camouflage. 'Furthermore, I am feeling unusually fine (more camouflage). I will see you later. God love you as I do.'
1922-02-07	The story of a wonderful love. A young girls' adoration beating its timorous wings under the shadow of impending calamity. When a carefully treasured letter fluttered from the pages of a book, Thursday, it revealed a love idyll charming in its conception, dramatic in its development, peculiarly sad in its unfullfilment. The love story of Mary Miles Minter and William Desmond Taylor. Out of the cloud of circumstances brought to light by the murder of the famous director shines the clear ray of this remarkable romance between the cultured, dignified man of 50 and the beautiful ingenue of 19. In the search of Mr. Taylor's effects, conducted the morning after he met his mysterious death, chance played a freakish role. The examination virtually had been concluded. One of the investigators, selecting a book from the case at random, idly fluttered the pages. Out dropped a letter. He picked it up and found it to be an ingenuous love letter written on heavily embossed stationery. 'Dearest: I love you--I love you--I love you,' it read. And below this reiterated sentence appeared a line of crosses followed by a single cross, heroic in size. At the end it said, 'Yours always. Mary.' And on the wings and body of the butterfly crest appeared the words, 'Mary Miles Minter.' Miss Minter did not deny the authorship of the letter. 'I did love William Taylor,' she said. 'I loved him deeply and tenderly, with all the admiration and respect a young girl gives to a man with the poise and culture of Mr. Taylor.'...
1922-02-07	Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill last night were questioning one of the most widely known motion picture actresses in the entire profession, expecting to secure vital information upon what several of the investigators believe to be the overshadowing theory in the William D. Taylor case. This theory is that a man who was in love with the actress in question, having the motive of jealousy, may have acted in response to the promptings of a wounded heart. Six headquarters men spent more than two yours late yesterday afternoon receiving the details of a story believed to be of great possible significance from C. M. Meister, a driver for the Yellow Taxicab Company. Meister was brought to police headquarters by S. Cooper, assistant general manager of the company. The narrative was, in substance, as follows: 'On last Wednesday night at 10:55 o'clock I picked up four passengers at 620 South Broadway--two men and two women. 'Upon entering the cab one of the men pulled up the window between themselves and me, apparently, so that I might not overhear their conversation. 'I drove them to a number in the Wilshire district. (The Examiner is in possession of this number, but is withholding it for the present at the request of the police.) 'One of the men and the two women left the cab and went into the apartment house. I afterwards learned that their apartment was on the second floor. 'The other man remained in the cab and asked me to drive him to the Ambassador Hotel. I did so. He was in the hotel about fifteen minutes. He came out, carrying a leather brief case. 'Shortly after entering the cab he appeared to show the greatest anxiety concerning this brief case. He handed it to me and said, 'I want you to deliver that. For God's sake, don't lose it.' 'His order to me was, 'Drive to 400 Alvarado street. At least, that was the number I caught. There was a 400 in it, but I am not sure whether it was the even number.' Taylor, it will be recalled, lived at 404-B South Alvarado. 'I said to him,' continued Meister, ''Don't you mean 400 ------ street,' naming it. ''Sure,' he said; 'I made a mistake.' 'He asked me several times if the brief case was safe. I said it was. But he was very uneasy. 'Give it to me,' he said, and he took it and put it beside him. 'When we reached the Santa Monica carline--at Santa Monica boulevard and Western avenue, I think it was, he asked me to stop. ''I'm going to take the car here,' he said. 'You will please deliver this,' and he handed me the brief case. ''There'll be a woman looking out the upstairs window waiting for it,' he told me. 'I drove directly to the number on ----- street. Immediately upon my arrival a woman rushed out and asked, 'Have you got it? Did he put it in a box?' 'I said, 'I guess this is what you mean,' and I gave her the brief case. 'Just then a man came running from the side of the house; he was the man I had let out there with the two women. 'He got into the cab. 'Drive me around,' he said--'just keep going around the block! 'I drove him around three or four blocks and then returned to the apartment house. There was a car--a roadster in front. 'When he saw this he became very much excited. 'Don't let them see me,' he said. 'Drive around again.' 'So I drove him around several blocks the second time. The car was still there when we returned, and in even greater excitement he said, 'Don't let them see me. Keep on driving until that car is gone.' 'Upon coming back the third time he asked, 'Is the car still there?' ''Yes,' I said, 'but they are turning on the light. I guess they are getting ready to leave.' 'Just then a street car passed us. 'Keep behind this car,' he said, 'so they won't see me.' 'But the street car went farther on than I had counted on and when we came opposite the roadster, which was then leaving, we were in plain view. 'Upon seeing this my passenger gave an exclamation of alarm, fell to the floor and pulled down the curtain on the side towards the roadster. 'When we stopped at the apartment house he got out and said, 'I was a ----- fool to do this thing'' The police last night were preparing to go to this house and question the occupants. What strikes them with greatest force is that the man who figured in the dramatic attempt at concealment wore a muffler around his neck. It was the man in the muffler whom Mrs. Douglas MacLean saw leaving Taylor's house the night of the murder. If this man had anything to do with the crime, a new theory enters. This is that the murder may have been committed between the time Meister took the four persons to the Wilshire street address and the time the man wearing the muffler rushed out and asked to be driven around the block--in other words while the first man was away on his errand to the Ambassador Hotel. Taylor's house is four blocks west of the home mentioned by the taxi driver. It would be possible to go from Taylor's apartment to this one through alleys, thus eluding detection. If Meister's passenger had anything to do with the crime, then, the police say, he must have called on Taylor soon after Mabel Normand left, probably had a talk with the film director and went away. Then came the episode of the brief case, which is supposed to have contained letters once possessed by Taylor and now missing. There was sufficient time while the first man had gone to the Ambassador for a person to have walked from the Wilshire street address to Taylor's house, committed the crime and returned. The only apparent discrepancy is as to the time the shot was fired. The police yesterday were taking a new view of this subject. Testimony that a shot was heard about 8 o'clock was so uncertain, they said, that no great reliance could be placed in it. On the other hand, a person has been found who heard a shot somewhere near 11 o'clock. The man with the muffler, it was learned yesterday, left for San Francisco the day following the murder. The police were greatly impressed with Meister's story, particularly those parts describing the actors in this mysterious drama as exceedingly nervous. First, the man who went to the hotel was excited and nervous over the brief case. The woman who rushed out to receive it was excited to the point of agitation. The man with the muffler was in a state of frenzy almost about being seen by the person or persons in the roadster. The woman who took the brief case is described as about 30. Meister took her to be a motion picture actress. The man who went to the Ambassador was about 30, of the business man type. The tall man in the muffler was about 35 and Meister supposed he was a motion picture actor. None of the Sheriff's officers seriously entertains the opinion that Edward F. Sands, discharged secretary-valet of Taylor, was the assassin. This is in contradiction to the strongly expressed opinion yesterday of Captain of Detectives David L. Adams. 'I am now completely convinced,' said Captain Adams, 'that Sands is the man we want. I believe it was he who committed the crime. 'We have today established important facts which enable us to reconstruct the crime with what we believe is absolute accuracy. 'Experiments made by our own and outside gun experts demonstrate beyond question that the shot which killed Taylor was fired from a distance of not more than an inch or two from his body. 'We have made many tests with the coat which he wore when the shot struck him down. In the test which produces a hole similar to that already appearing in the coat the muzzle of the revolver was held an inch from the garment. 'When Taylor was shot he had his left arm up. 'We believe that the murderer ordered 'Hands up!' and shot him when he obeyed that command. 'The way I re-frame the picture is this: Sands was lurking around waiting for an opportunity to enter the house, possibly for robbery, and it may have been for some deeper purpose which we have not fathomed. 'The known facts concerning the attitude of this man towards Taylor convince me that we do not know the whole story; we are still far from explaining, for instance, why Sands sent Taylor the pawn ticket and the letter signed 'Alias Jimmy V.' We are also in the dark as to why Sands used Taylor's old name, 'Deane-Tanner,' when he pawned the stolen jewelry. 'Either when or after Taylor accompanied Miss Normand to her car, leaving the front door open, this man slipped into the house. And when the director entered he was there, covering Taylor with his revolver. 'It is possible that Sands went there to secure something--a letter or a document, perhaps--and that he actually did carry away something. 'It is urged against the Sands theory that he would have robbed the dead body, would have stripped off the diamond ring, extracted the money from the pockets and taken the platinum watch. 'I have no doubt he would have done so under ordinary circumstances, as his whole career proves him to be a thief, but this situation was extraordinary. Without having purposed to do so, it may be, he murdered his former master. 'And then, panic-stricken, he hurried from the house, his terror overcoming for the moment his natural instinct to rob.' Although Captain Adams urges his theory with great earnestness, a number of the men working under him do not accept his view of the crime. They cannot conceive that Sands, if he were the man, would have passed over jewelry and money worth nearly $2000 and to be had for the stooping down and taking. However, Captain Adams yesterday issued this instruction: 'Find Edward F. Sands. Whether he is the murderer or not, he must be eliminated.' The identity of the person who extracted the Mabel Normand letters from Taylor's effects remained as much of a mystery yesterday as on the first day of the investigation. It is believed that a man of high position and great influence in the motion picture world found and took these, and others, thinking their discovery would injure the fortunes of actresses in whom he has a business interest. Public Administrator Frank Bryson yesterday admitted that he did not know where they were nor who took them. 'When our representative arrived at the Taylor home Thursday morning,' said Mr. Bryson, 'the room was filled with detectives, motion picture people and reporters, and the premises were swarming with them. 'This office took over all property, effects and documents involved in the estate. Naturally all letters he left belonged to the estate and it was illegal to remove anything. However, I do not understand that anything of money value was taken.' Several letters received yesterday by the police department and the Sheriff's office relating to the record of Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored valet, led Captain Adams to question the negro at greater length regarding his possible knowledge. Peavey is the man who found Taylor's body and gave the alarm. According to Captain Adams, Peavey said nothing new of importance. It is the natural assumption of the detectives and Sheriff's officers that Peavey must have known the persons who called on Taylor. He has stated, however, that only four or five persons called during his six month's service with the director. Among these were Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean and Mabel Normand. In trying to learn what persons were entertained, Sheriff's officers have made a widespread investigation. Yesterday, it is reported, they learned from a source what may or not be authentic--that is something being investigated--that a noted film actress who has been mentioned frequently in stories relating to the case, made several calls at Taylor's apartment at night. It is also asserted by this same person that the actress said she was engaged to marry Taylor; that, in fact, they were to be married within a few weeks. But about New Year's Taylor and the woman had a violent quarrel and the director returned home under stress to such great emotion that he broke down and cried. This actress is one of those who wrote many letters to the picture director, and it is her letters particularly about the disappearance of which the police are so curious. Following yesterday's discovery that the bullet was fired at short range, the theory of suicide was advanced. The absence of a weapon would appear to make this entirely untenable. Also, according to the findings of Dr. A. F. Wagner, county autopsy surgeon, it would have been practically impossible for Taylor to have shot himself in the manner employed. It is only by a wild flight of imagination that one could picture him as a suicide, the police say, because there would have to be discovered in this theory some person who entered the apartment after the tragedy and took the revolver away.
1922-02-07	There can be no girl who was jealous of Mr. Taylor's attentions to me. His attitude toward me was only that of a friend who fostered my interest in the better things of life--music, painting and books. 'We never spoke of love, neither of us was interested in the other in that way. If there was a girl with whom he was infatuated it surely was someone else, not I.' Mabel Normand, famous motion picture star, ill from the persistent questioning by those who are seeking to find some one who might have taken the life of William D. Taylor in a spirit of frenzied jealousy, vehemently denied yesterday any love element that existed between her and the slain director. 'Shortly after the inquest Saturday detectives investigating the case came to me and thanked me for my cooperation in aiding in the solving of this terrible tragedy,' she said. 'They told me they are thoroughly convinced it was an unfortunate coincidence that I was seen with him a short time before his murder. 'Everything that I know that might lead to detection of the murderer I have told them. And no one would welcome the apprehension of the culprit that committed that foul deed more than I. 'There have been insinuations made that I went to Mr. Taylor's house after the inquest Saturday to seek some of my letters to him. That is grossly erroneous. I went to the bungalow at the request of the detectives and in their company and solely for the purpose of showing to them the exact location of the furniture as it was placed in the room before I left. It was to show how disordered the place had become after the intrusion of the murderer. 'If Peavey, his colored servant, says that I had asked him about any girls that Mr. Taylor had ever been interested in, it is a venomous fabrication. Never in my life have I spoken to this man directly, and never have I talked to him in any way except in the presence of others, including Mr. Taylor. And as for the subject of girls--the question never entered my mind.' Miss Normand, heavy-lidded from lack of sleep, and worn from the grueling inquisitions to which she has been subjected since the murder, reiterated that no one welcomed the apprehension of the culprit more than she. As for the insinuations that Mr. Taylor had been an attendant at so- called 'dope' parties, she added another vehement denial. 'He loved clean, simple pleasures, not this sordid type,' she said. He was one of the most temperate men in his habits I have ever known. 'He sent me flowers, occasionally, yes. But it was only because he knew I loved them and like to have them about my house. But there never was an expression of love sent with them. He knew our friendship didn't extend to that--it was purely platonic, and like that of an older man interested in a girl who sought mental improvement, and the things that better one in the cultural world.'
1922-02-07	Los Angeles, Feb. 6--A pale pink nightgown of filmy silk, trimmed with lace, positively identified as the property of a certain famous motion picture star--whose name has already been mentioned in connection with the murder at his home here last Wednesday night of William Desmond Taylor, photo- play director--is now in the possession of the police and may play a dominant part in a solution of the mystery of Taylor's death. Other developments of the day were an assertion by Taylor's valet that Mabel Normand had told him she was going to marry the picture director, and renewed search for a young New York man now supposed to be at the Mexican border. The nightgown, previously described to the police by servants of the slain director, disappeared from Taylor's apartment on the day after the murder, but was found today after a diligent search by the authorities investigating the tragedy... In this case, it is said, the star to whom the nightgown is believed to belong is not a comedienne. The police do say the article has been identified positively as the property of a 'celebrated motion picture star,' however. A laundry mark of three letters gave police their clues to the ownership of the dainty garment. It had been kept in a box in a drawer of Taylor's dresser, Henry Peavey, negro valet of the murdered director, admitted. Peavey told the police, under pressure, that the gown had mysteriously disappeared the day after the murder. It was not until late today that it turned up, in the hands of a police detective who had been working independently on the case. This detective obtained what he declared to be positive identification of the nightgown. The injection of the woman film star into the mystery gives rise to more speculation about the identity of the assassin, as it enlarges the field of suspects to include all of the many men admirers of the girl, for at the present time the police view every intimate friend of the women who were known to be close associates of Taylor as a potential enemy and possible murderer through the jealousy which Taylor's attachment may have aroused...
1922-02-07	New York, Feb. 6--Lila Wylie, the beautiful actress who entered the limelight in New York last spring in connection with the 'international blackmail ring' expose following the shooting of John Reid, wealthy manufacturer, is sought for questioning in the Taylor murder case in Los Angeles, it was learned today. Miss Wylie's possible connection with the mystery is said to be linked with that of 'Dapper Don' Collins, also sought by the Los Angeles police. The authorities expect her to shed considerable light on her own activities as they concerned William Desmond Taylor during the weeks just preceding the murder. Miss Wylie disappeared from Los Angeles on the day the Taylor murder was discovered. She is not suspected of the crime, but the police expect her knowledge of Taylor to aid them. The police say they have traced her movements to Miami, Fla., where she is supposed to be registered at a fashionable resort hotel...
1922-02-07	E Los Angeles, Feb. 6--...Capt. Adams' conference in his office late today with Charles Eyton, referred to the scenes at the bungalow. And eventually they got back to Mabel's letters. 'I had heard about those letters,' the captain said. 'I looked for them when I went to the house Thursday noon, some time after Taylor's body had been found. They were gone.' 'It is possible some of Taylor's friends who got there first took the letters,' Eyton said. 'I would have taken them if I had been there in time.' There were perhaps a dozen film stars at the house before the police arrived. One of the first to get there was Arthur Hoyt, a friend of long standing.
1922-02-07	That William D. Taylor, murdered movie director, was held at the point of a pistol before he was murdered was the theory expressed by detectives Tuesday. In support of this theory, the police bring out these points: Taylor's shirt was pulled somewhat out of his belt. Holding his hands in the air while menaced with a revolver would account for that. The slayer evidently held the gun within three or four inches of Taylor's body, as powder marks on the clothing indicate. As Taylor fell, the assassin might have caught him and laid him on his back. The fact that there were no bruises on Taylor's head or body, which would have been caused had he fallen, accounts for this conjecture. Having his hands in the air would explain why the bullet missed Taylor's arm. The assassin evidently shot from the hip, the way of a two-gun bad man, the detectives point out, thus sending the bullet on its diagonal course through the ribs, heart and into the neck.
1922-02-07	...Guards surrounded the home of Mary Miles Minter, prominent film star and close friend of Taylor, Tuesday. Captain David L. Adams and the squad of eight police detectives who are working on the mystery, scattered to various parts of the city following a conference. They were working on a number of clues, any one of which may develop into something tangent. Before the detectives left police headquarters they subjected Henry Peavey, Taylor's Negro valet, to another questioning, but the valet was unable to tell them anything new. The four private detectives, who guarded the home of Mary Miles Minter on North Hobart boulevard, shooed all visitors away. They are supposed to have been hired by Miss Minter... A cigarette stub carelessly dropped in front of a garage at Temple and Hill streets may lead to the discovery of the murderer of Taylor. If the police could have laid hands on the man who dropped the bit of paper wrapped around a few shreds of tobacco the mystery that has baffled the entire country would be solved today. But the man slipped through their hands with a margin of only a few minutes between him and capture. The smoker, an indistinct figure, lounged in the doorway of the garage in the darkness of night. A man drove in with his automobile and the smoker stepped aside, casting away the cigarette. The driver, engaged in negotiating the doorway, did not once glance... But a few minutes later a policeman picked up the cigarette stub and examined it. It was gold-tipped and bore the special design seen only on the cigarettes made to order for Taylor. Nino Andrinie, editor of 'La Patria,' an Italian newspaper, was the motorist who drove into the garage while the man was lounging in the doorway. The policeman who found the cigarette stub awakened the editor at his apartments in the Alhambra a few hours later and questioned him. Andrinie could not give a good description of the man he saw. The police theory that Edward F. Sands, former secretary of the movie director may know who committed the murder, was strengthened greatly by the cigarette clue... 'If we can find Sands,' declared Captain David L. Adams, in charge of the police investigation, 'this mystery will be solved. Unless he can account for his whereabouts Wednesday night he will be under the strongest possible suspicion.' Telegraphic orders for the arrest of a man believed to be Sands were sent to Carlin, Nev., where a man answering his description is under surveillance. The arrest was expected today... The startling theory that Sands is in reality Taylor's missing brother, Dennis, was scouted as impossible today by Mrs. Ada Deane-Tanner, divorced wife of the missing man. Mrs. Deane-Tanner, when shown a photograph of Sands at her Monrovia home, pointed out points of dissimilarity which led to this theory, developed by detectives working on the baffling murder mystery, to be discarded. Sands is short and stocky, with plump, round face. Dennis Deane-Tanner was slender like his brother, and his clear-cut features much resembled those of the murdered director. Besides, Mrs. Deane-Tanner explained, her husband's nose had been broken in athletics, which gave him a noticeable mark. Neither could there be any possibility, according to her, that Taylor was her missing husband, playing a dual role. She and other friends who knew both brothers in New York, saw and talked to Taylor in Los Angeles and could not be deceived about his identity... So far two reported 'sons' of Taylor have been heard from and are being traced. One of the young men, about 25 years of age, introduced himself as a son of the eminent director when he took some manuscript to F. H. McDowell, associate editor of 'Screenland,' about two weeks ago. The police today were looking for the young man at the address which he left with McDowell. The other youth who claimed to be Taylor's son, was interviewed by a man who knew the movie director when the boy registered for war service at Columbia University, New York. The young man was reported as being very bitter towards Taylor, cursing at mention of his name. He did not say why he hated the man whom he represented as his father.
1922-02-07	...As regarded the statement often made that Taylor was exclusively a man's man, it was said today by his former employees that such was not the case; that Taylor on numerous occasions talked to one screen actress for 30 minutes at a time over the telephone. He would also send lengthy letters to her in the middle of the day. He was said to have had many women friends.
1922-02-07	...In an effort to aid in Sands' arrest Charles Eyton, general manager of the film organization with which Taylor was formerly connected, today ordered the printing of 10,000 circulars giving a full description of the fugitive. These will be sent broadcast throughout the nation, it was announced...
1922-02-07	PRESS FILM STAR FOR TAYLOR CLEW Police Conduct'Long and Grueling' Examination, working on Jealousy Motive. MABEL. MORMAMD SPEAKS  Tellis Reporters Affections for Slain Director was Based on Comradeship, Not 'Love.' LOs ANGELES, Feb. 6.A motion picture actress was subjected to what the police termed a "long and grueling" examination at her home here tonight in an attempt to obtain a clew to the murderer of William Desmond Taylor. The actress was said to be widely known, but her name was withheld by the police, Two detective sergeants examined her. What they learned they kept to themselves. They admitted they were seeking to develop the previously advanced theory that Taylor had been slain by a jealous rival for the affections of the actress. Mabel Normand, who was among the last persons to see Taylor alive, made a number of declarations "on her word of honor" to newspaper interviewers today. Not in "Love" with Taylor. "Were you ever in love with Taylor?" they asked her. "Not in the way one means when he uses the expression "in love," On my word of honor, no," she said. "Get it straight. Our friendship was based on comradeship and understanding." "Did you know any woman who might have been jealous of you-who might have loved Taylor?" "On my word of honor, no." "Or any man who might have been jealous of the place he occupied in your esteem?" "On my word of honor, no." "It has been hinted he gave drug parties. Did you ever hear of them" "Never in God's world, never, on my word of honor." After some questions, she said: "And, oh please, say that I never heard of that pink silk night robe they say is missing from Mr. Taylor's apartments." "But Henry Peavey, the negro houseman, said " " He ought to be ashamed of himself for saying I asked him about other girls. going to Mr. Taylors house," she exclaimed. I saved him his job once when Mr. Taylor wanted to fire him," If Sands, the missing butler, can be found the complaint against him chargeing grand larceny, made by Taylor and now in the hands of the police, will be dropped, it was announced tonight by Captain Adams, who stated that as Taylor was dead the case could not be taken to court. Therefore, he added, if Sands could clear himself of all connection with Taylor's death no other charge would be placed against him. Adams said he had information which led him to believe that regardless of where Sands might have been last Wednesday night he was not in Los Angeles at present. He said none of the persons who had stated Sands was in the city just before the murder had said they had talked with him. Several women with whom Sands was said to have been friendly have been interviewed by the police, and all are reported to have stated that they had neither seen nor heard from him for months. Investigate Chautfeur's Clue. An unidentified "party of men" was driven to the neighborhood of the Taylor apartment the night be was murdered, according to a story told the police today by a taxicab driver. What else the chauffeur told the police they did not make public, but it was known that in the search for the slayer of the motion picture director, the detectives examined six men today. These included Charles Eyton, general manager of the Famous Players-Lasky Company, by which Taylor had been employed, and Henry Peavey, negro house servant of the head dirctor. The examination of the four unnamed men including the chauffeur, was in furtherance of the search for Edward F. Sands, or Edward Fitz Strathmore, the missing butler. The chauffeur's suspicions were said to have been aroused after reading of the murder, and he communicated his  knowledge to the police, He and a companion were in secret conference with the police several hours and during that period took a hurried automobile ride with the detectives. Two of the four men were said to have entered into the investigation for the first time today. Twice during the day all the detectives working on the case were called together in conference with Captain Adams, They said they were concentrating their efforts in an attempt to locate Sands. Mr. Eyton had a long talk with Captain Adams, and Peavey was examined again. Late in the day the detectives asserted letters known to have been in Taylor's possession just before his death, in addition to those said to have been written by Mabel Normand and sought by her in vain at his apartment after his body was found, were missing. No one examined by the police so far has admitted any knowledge of the whereabouts of the missing letters. Eyton said he had not seen them. Miss Normand stated she had not. The Public Administrator, who has charge of the Taylor estate, said he had not seen them, and the District Attorney made a like statement. Eyton's visit to the Central Police Station, it was said, was in relation to the efforts to find Sands. Eyton aided the police in obtaining photographs  of Sands, but no really good portraits of him are available, it is said. It was determined today that the bullet that killed Taylor was fired from a distance of a very few inches. This was taken as evidence that the assassin did not conceal himself in some part of the room and fire from a distance of ten or more feet, and it was also taken to indicate that the overturned chair might have been upset in a brief struggle between Taylor and his slayer. The facts in relation to Taylor's change of name from that of William Cunningham Deane-Tanner are also being studied. It is generally believed, however, that this was due to Taylor's desire to be free from his former family relations, and to the ordinary custom of screen and stage stars and workers whereby they assume any name that happens to appeal to them. Early today police and attachés of the Sheriff's office again examined the dead man's papers in the hope of obtaining a better clue than any yet evolved." George Milo, the motion picture actor, who was taken from his work last night and examined as to his whereabouts at the time of the shooting, was freed of all connection with the case, as the result of his statement and the investigation that later verified his story. "Mr. Taylor loved Mabel Normand, but I do not believe that she returned his love to any great extent," Harry Peavey, houseman for Taylor, is reported to have told representatives of The Los Angeles Times. "I was in Mr. Taylor's home for almost six months, and I know that Mr. Taylor was very much in love with Miss Normand. At times I thought that she returned his love and then again it seemed to me that she was tired of him. "One night, almost a month before Mr. Taylor was killed, Miss Normand came to the house for dinner. After dinner I passed through the front room while they were talking, and she stopped me and told me that she and Mr. Taylor were to be married. He was sitting there and did not say a word. She wanted to know if I would work for them. She never came often. While I worked there she was there only about a dozen times. She was there the night before the murder and the night of the murder. I know she was there Tuesday night, the night before the murder, because she told me so. Mr. Taylor wrote a letter to Miss Normand almost every day of the week. His driver would take notes to Miss Normand's home by automobile after breakfast in the mornings. He sent flowers to her three days a week. "Once Miss Normand asked me what other girls had dined with Mr. Taylor. I told her there was only one. She asked me the name, and I told her: "Miss Normand." She laughed and said that Mr. Taylor had me well trained. Miss Normand was with Mr. Taylor the last time I saw him alive. My master asked me to mix up some cocktails, and I did. I placed the liquor in the shaker on a tray with two glasses, and Mr. Taylor and Miss Normand were drinking when I left for the evening. They both said goodnight to me and I left the house. When I next saw Mr. Taylor, the next morning, he was dead on the floor of his living room. Search for New Yorker. The jealousy theory, the police and private detectives reported, was causing a search to be made for a prominent young New York man, formerly engaged to a film star. This man was reported today to have checked out of a hotel here on the day of the murder and to have left the City the following afternoon. He is believed to have headed for San Diego and possibly to have crossed the border into Mexico. His name is withheld. The actress to whom he was at one time engaged, according to investigators, was a close friend of the slain director, and in this friendship, they say, they see a possible motive for jealousy which might lead to murder. The police today were looking for the pink silk nightgown missing from Taylor's home. Sands Reported in Nevada. A man said to answer the description of Sands, the missing butler, is in Carlin, Nev,, tonight, according to messages received by the Los Angeles police tonight. Not. Listed at Fusilier Officer. Copyright, 1922, by The Chicago Tribune Co. LONDON, Feb. 6. William Desmond Taylor was never an officer attached to the Fifth Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, according to the official records of the Fusiliers, who are now stationed at Hounslow Barracks, London, where the Adjutant searched through 46,000 names of officers and men of the regiment who were in the World War at the request of The Chicago Tribune today. The official record lists, however, "W. D. Taylor. address 1,127 Orange Street, Los Angeles, aged 41: profession, director: Born Cork, Ireland: height. 5 feet 11 inches: British subject: enlistment attested at Chicago, July 3. 1918, by the British Recruiting Mission in  America. The next official trace of Taylor is when he arrived at Hounslow Barracks, Dec. 2, 1918, after the armisfice, as a private in the ranks of the  Royal Fusiliers, coming in a draft of 500 Britishers who had enlisted in America. A veteran enlisted man of the regiment remembers that Taylor said he was Mary Pickford's director. Taylor was at Hounslow three days, and is said to have been Acting Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant. On Dec. 5, 1918, he he was transferred to the army service corps at the Expeditionary Force canteen on Victoria Street, London. Praises Taylor as Soldier. William Desmond Taylor, the moving picture director murdered in Hollywood. won the affection and respect of every one who came in contact with him while he was in the British Army, and Stuart E. Cooling of 2,374 Third Avenue, Provost Sergeant of the camp where Taylor entered the service, swore that no matter what any one said about Bill Taylor he would never believe scandal in connection with him. Cooling was on duty in Ireland in 1887 with the Fourth Hussars and is sure that Dr. Deane-Tanner, a friend and associate of Parnell and an infiuential man in the old Nationalist Party. was an uncle of Taylor or William Cunningharm Deane-Tanner his right name, Taylor, he said, "came to Camp Fort Edward at Windsor, Nova Scotia, in the Summer of 1919 with other recruits. I was Provost Sergeant. He was very quick to learn and became a Lance Corporal in two weeks, a Corporal in three weeks, a Sergeant in five weeks. and a company Sergeant Major in two months. Then we went to England and he got a Lieutenant's commission in the Army Service corps of the British Army. His men worshipped himwould do anything for him. We N. C. O.'s, his pals, always found him a man who never thought of himself, who was always helping the underdog, those who had less than he had. I wouidn't believe wrong of him, no matter what anybody said."  
1922-02-07	GRILL FILM ACTRESS Unnamed Woman Cross-questioned in Taylor 's Death. MEN NEAR MURDER SCENE Chauffeur Tells of Driving "Party;" Six Under Examination. Missing New Yorker Now Sought. Actor Arrested Sunday Is Freed. Must Find Sands, Slain Man's Butler, Say Officers, Who Are Working on Elimination Theory. More Letters Declared Missing.   (By the Associated Press.) Los Angeles, Calif., Feb. 6. -A motion picture actress was subjected to what the police termed a "long and gruelling" questioning at her home here tonight in an attempt to obtain a clew to the murder of William Desmond Taylor, director. The actress was said to be widely known, but her name was withheld by the police. Two detective sergeants questioned her. What they learned they kept to themselves, but they admitted they were seeking to develop the previously advanced theory that Taylor had been slain by a jealous rival for the affections of the actress.   New Theory of Murder. A new theory as to the exact manner in which William Desmond Taylor was slain last Wednesday night, was advanced tonight. Detectives said they were convinced the director was standing with his hands above his head when a 88 calibre pistol was pressed against his side, about six inches below the left arm-pit and toward the back. They based this theory on a careful examination today of the clothing worn by the director at the time he was shot. The holes in the coat and in the vest do not correspond as to location when the coat is adjusted normally. When the sleeves were raised the hole in the coat was brought up to the hole in the vest.   Drove Party of Men. An unidentified "party of men" was a driven to the vicinity of the apartments of Taylor the night he was murdered, according to the story told the police by a taxicab deriver. What else the chauffeur told the police the latter did not make public but it was known that in the search, for the slayer of the motion picture director, detectives questioned six men today. These include Charles Eyton, genneral manager of the Famous PlayersLasky company, by which Taylor had been employed, and Henry Peavey, negro house servant of the dead director. The questioning  of the four unnamed men, which included the chauffeur, was in furtherance of the search for Edward F. Sands, or Edward Fitz Strathmore, the missing former butler for Taylor.   Chauffeur Informs Police. The chauffeur 's suspicions were said to have been aroused after reading of the murder and he communicated his knowledge to the police. He and a companion were in secret conference with the police several hours, and during that period took a hurried automobile ride with the detectives. Two of the four men were said to have entered into the investigation for the first time today. Twice during the day all the detectives working on the case were called together in conference with Captain of Detectives David Adams. They declared they were concentrating their efforts in an attempt to locate Sands. Mr. Eyton had a long talk with Capt. Adams and Peavey also was questioned again. Late in the day officers declared letters known to have been in Taylor 's possession shortly before his death, in addition, to those said to have been written by Mabel Normand, film actress, and sought by her in vain at his apartment after his body was found, were missing.   Not seen By Eyton. No one questioned by the police so far, has admitted any knowledge of their whereabouts. Eyton said he had not seen them. Miss Normand stated she had not. The public administrator, who has charge of the Taylor estate, said he had not seen the letters and the district attorney made a like statement. Eyton's visit to the central police station, it was said, is in connections with the efforts of the, officers to find Sands, who is said to have been near the Taylor apartment as little as two hours before the shooting. Eyton aided the officers in obtaining photographs of Sands, but no  really good picture of him is avail able, it is said. The investigation has simmered down to the process of elimination, according to Capt. Adams, hundreds of "tips" having come to the is police from various sources, solicited and unsolicited. Miss Normand, through a representative, announced today she planned to have her telephone number changed to avoid "the continual stream of calls" reaching her recently.   Must Capture Sands. "Edward F. Sands must be captured in order that his elimination may be  made complete or a charge entered against him," said Capt. David L Adams, in charge of the police investigation. CONTINUED ON FIFTH PAGE.   GRILL FLM ACTRESS   CONTINUED FROM FIRST PAGE. It was determined by police investigation today that the bullet that killed Taylor was fired point blank; that is, from a distance of a very few inches. This was taken as evidence that his assailant did not conceal himself in some other part of the room and fire from a distance of 10 or more feet: and it was also taken to indicate that the overturned chair might have been upset in a brief struggle between Taylor and his slayer. These salient points had emerged from a mass of contradictory stories and statements, some of which were based on theories, as yet unproven, that Taylor was engaged in clandestine affairs with various women.   Many persons questioned. So far, numerous people prominent in the motien picture world have had at least a slight connection with the affair. In this number may be listed  Mabel Normand, who was the last person to visit Mr. Taylor before the shooting occured. He escorted her to her automobile and returned to the room where he met his death, according to the facts so far established. Another widely known movie star, whose name was brought into the case was Mary Miles Minter, who had been a business and social acquaintance of the dead man and who was one of the first to be advised of his death. Then Charles Eyton, production manager at the Lasky studios, where Mr. Taylor was employed, was frequently named because he was one of the first to arrive at the scene after Henry Peavey, colored houseman, found the body: and because he was quite active in early investigation. Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean, also known in the screen world, told of having seen a an leave the Taylor house at the hour of the shooting: and various others, some approaching the magnitude of stars, and others from the owly extra ranks, have touched various angles of the affair.   Sands Name Always Up. In all these investigations, repeated reccurence of the name of Sands finally led to the declaration of Captain Adams that Sands' discovery was esential to further progress. Sands has not been seen here since the shooting, nor is there any definite proof that he was seen here immeditely preceding it. Officers said he might be concealing himself because he feared to face a grand larceny charge preferred against him by Taylor and still pending. This charge, they said, was no longer serious because without the testimony of Taylor conviction would be difficult, but they admitted that Sands might not realize this condition.   Seek Missing New Yorker. Jealousy, police and private detertives reported today, has directed search for a prominent young New York man, formerly engaged to ones of the beautiful stars of filmdom. This suspect was reported today to have checked out of a hotel here on the day of the murder and left the city the following afternoon. He is believed by investigators to have headed for San Diego and possibly erossed the border into Mexico. His name is withheld by the police.   Actor Is Set Free. George. Milo, motion picture actor who was taken from his work last night by deputy sheriffs and submitted to questioning as to his whereabouts at the time of the shooting of William Desmond Taylor. last Wednesday night, was freed of all connection with the case as the result of his statement and the investlgation that later verified his story. Henri Reineque, another actor, why has also served as a camera man, was questioned with Milo, but it wasnt stated that his story was desired merely as a check on that of tone other man, and that he had no other connection with the case.   it was impossible that William Desmond Taylor, the slain motion picture director, could have been her husband, Dennis. "It is absurd," she said. "I knew! build., Dennis was five feet nine inches, and William was about six feet. It couldnt be possible that they were the same man, for I met and knew them both, but my aunt Mrs. John Ketcham, of Buffalo, prob   ably did not meet them both. I could like to correct published statecwaents about my husband, Dennis. *He never associated with other one women. "I feel confident that if Dennis is esiyve, that his existence could not possibly have any connection with cease murder. The brothers were very match devoted to each other,"   Aunt sure of Ideatity. Buffalo, N. I. Feb. (.Mirs. John Ketcham, aunt of Mis. Ada Deane Tanner, of Monrovia, today expressed the belief that William Desmond braylor, slain cinema director, is in weality Dennis Deane Tanner and that Dennis Deane Tanner and Willam Cunningham Deane Tanner are otdfntical. Mrs. Ada Deane Tanner 's ireame was Ada Brennan. She was taochn in Buffalo and was married in Itdw York It years ago, Mrs. Ketchinarh said. "I met Dennis Deane Tanner in New York before he married Ada," hiafs. Ketcham continued. "Never did is hear of him having a brother. Nor said I ever hear of William Cunningessim Deane Tanner, supposed to be a "brother of the slain man. I am almost certain that he had no brother." As late photograph of Taylor was shown to Mrs. Ketcham today. She said it resembled Dennis Deane anner but she would not be positive about the identification, saying that She had not seen the man since he married her niece 16 years ago. Miss Brennan married Dennis Deane adanner in 1906. Two children were corn to them. Mrs. Deane Tanner 's health failed and it was while she was at a mountain resort that her husband disappeared. Later she moved to California.   Valet Sure Taylor Loved Miss Normand; Unrequ   Los Angeles, Feb. 6.-"Mr. Taylor loved Mabel Normand, but I do not believe that she returned his love to any "great extent," Harry Peavey, the Rouseman, is reported to have told representatives of the Los Angeles Times. "I was in Mr. Taylor 's house for almost six months and I know that Mr. Taylor was very much in love with Miss Normand. At times thought that she returned his love and then again it seemed to me that she was tired of him 'One night, almost a month before Mr. Taylor was killed, Miss Norman came to the house for dinner. After dinner I passed through the free room while they were talking and she stopped me and told me that she and Mr. Taylor were to be married. He was sitting there and did not say a word. She wanted to know if I would work for them. She never came often While I worked there she was on there about a dozen times "She was there the night before the murder and the night of the murder I know she was there Tuesday night the night before the murder, because she told me so. Mr. Taylor wrote his letter to Miss Normand almost every day of the week. His driver would take notes to Miss Normands home to her automobile after breakfast. He sent flowers to her three days a week. "Once Miss Normand asked me what other girls had dined with Mr. Taylor. told her there was only one. She asked me the name, and I told her. "Miss Normand," She laughed and said that Mr. Taylor had me well trained. Miss Normand was with Mr, Taylor the last time I saw him alive, and master asked me to mix up some coctails, and I did. I placed the liquor in the shaker on a tray with two glasses and Mr. Taylor and Miss Normand were drinking when I left for the evening. They both said good-night to me as I left the house, When I next saw Mr. Taylor, the next morning, he was dead on the fioor in his living  room.

Feb. 6.-Constable Beining. at Carlin, New, telephoned police headquarters tonight that he had a man answering the descr of Edward F. Sands, missing former valet of William Desmond Tayler, under arrest. Sands is want ed as a material witness in the myterious killing of the film direetor. Carlin is near Reno.   
1922-02-08	Only by the exercise of supreme self-restraint has Congress refrained so far from appointing a commission to go on a California excursion to investigate picture studio shenanigan.
1922-02-08	The angle eliminated today was the theory that the New York broker who came here, ostensibly to marry Miss Mary Miles Minter, might have slain the director out of jealousy. It was well known that Taylor idolized the girl. It was learned today, however, that the young man did not flee the city the day after the murder from any apprehension. The management of the hotel at which he was guest, had requested him to leave. The broker brought a film actor and two extra girls into his room. It is declared that the quartet was noisy and that people in nearby rooms summoned the hotel detective. The latter declares there was much drink in the place. He says further that when he asked the women to leave the men assaulted him.
1922-02-08	(letter written to Taylor by Mary Miles Minter) 'You Wonderful Man! I Want to Go Away With You--Alone,' Is Opening Here is another unsigned love letter, in cipher, found in the effects of William D. Taylor, the motion picture director. This letter would indicate the writer's deep love for Taylor. The code is known to thousands of youngsters: What shall I call you, you wonderful man. You are standing on the lot, the idol of an adoring company. You have just come over and put your coat on my chair. I want to go away with you, up in the hills or anywhere just so we'd be alone--all alone. In a beautiful little woodland lodge you'd be cook (as I can only make tea) and fetch the water and build the fire. Wouldn't it be glorious to sit in a big comfy couch by a cozy warm fire with the wind whistling outside trying to harmonize with the faint sweet strains of music coming from our victrola. And then you'd have to get up and take off the record. Of course, I don't mean that, dear. Did you really suppose I intended you to take care of me like a baby? Oh no, for this is my part. I'd sweep and dust (they make the sweetest, little dust caps, you know) and tie fresh ribbons on the snowy white curtains and feed the birds and fix the flowers, and, oh, yes, set the table and help you wash the dishes and then in my spare time I'd darn your socks. I'd go to my room and put on something soft and flowing, then I'd lie on the couch and wait for you. I might fall asleep for a fire always makes me drowsy--then I'd wake to find two strong arms around me and two dear lips pressed on mine in a long sweet kiss - (THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THIS LETTER IS BEING WITHHELD BY THE EXAMINER FROM PUBLICATION AT THIS TIME)
1922-02-08	A complaint charging Sands with the murder was to be issued today by the district attorney's office. William Doran, chief deputy district attorney, said there was no doubt in his mind that Sands is the guilty man.
1922-02-08	(Los Angeles)--Captain of Detectives David Adams made the flat statement today that secret information in his possession positively links Sands with the slaying and the police were concentrating their efforts upon a search for the former secretary. 'We have obtained secret information that we believe virtually solves the murder,' Captain Adams stated. 'We are centering our efforts on the location of Sands. This information has not been made public, nor will it be, but it is positive in its character.'
1922-02-08	William D. Taylor, slain film director, was the dude of Dawson City, according to Adelbert Bartlett of Santa Monica, who knew him in Alaska [sic] in 1910. He wore tweeds, a soft crush hat, tasteful haberdashery, and was immensely popular with the women. He played crack tennis, was a card expert and attended most of the big functions in a dress suit, one of the few dress suits in the town. At that time Mr. Taylor was timekeeper for the Yukon Gold Company at $175 a month. 'Mr. Taylor gave me the impression of a man on a mysterious mission. At times he would obscure himself and nobody would know where he was and then again, he would embark on the heights of sociability. All of the women were interested in him. The country was more or less unconventional and he was frequently the escort of married women. In a perfectly proper way, of course. 'There was one case in particular, however, that impressed me at the time as liable to lead to trouble. Every morning at 10 o'clock he would have a tete-a-tete over the telephone with a woman. One woman was the wife of a high employee of the company, and there was some gossip. 'I used to wonder why a man of his personality and culture should spend his time there at such meager pay and the fact that he was always somewhat mysterious enhanced this question. 'He was thoroughly familiar with the Yukon Territory and I understood that he had been there in 1898 and 1899. He used to show me many places of interest. Robert W. Service, the poet, Mr. Taylor and myself have played together. 'Mr. Taylor was rather a quiet fellow, but always an outstanding figure. He attended the society affairs given by the Governor of the Territory and by the local celebrities and made himself generally agreeable, too. 'Lots of us guessed that he was a typical English remittance man. If Mr. Taylor was murdered because of any of his actions up there in the Klondike the grudge must have been harbored for a long time.'
1922-02-08	Dawson City, Feb. 7.--Records of the Yukon Gold Company indicate that William Desmond Taylor, motion-picture director who was found dead with a bullet wound in his neck [sic] in Los Angeles recently, added to his multifarious lists of trades during his sojourn in the Yukon. In Dawson he worked as timekeeper and commissary clerk from 1908 to 1913 [sic]. He is remembered as an efficient commissary clerk in several creek stations of the Yukon Gold Company. At Claim Seventy-six 'below' on Bonanza creek, he is referred to as a record-breaker in holding down grub allowances. He rode horseback for pastime and wrote short stories, which were published, it was said, in outside magazines. It is believed that he originally came from England. In the four- year period mentioned, he was absent from the Yukon one winter when he went to Honolulu with a theatrical company.
1922-02-08	Los Angeles, Feb. 7--...Meantime the Sheriff's office has announced than an arrest will be made before morning and that the person arrested will not be Sands. The 'woman' theory was strengthened by Mabel Normand. She denied that she was infatuated with Taylor or Taylor with her, but admitted it might have appeared so to a jealous person and that 'it might be another girl.' Despite her disavowal of love for Taylor, Miss Normand collapsed at his funeral, held in the procathedral here today. An actress who had been severely grilled a few nights ago was questioned again today. It is believed her sweetheart may know something of the murder. He was jealous of Taylor, it is said. The 'tip' that Sands was hiding near Carlin, Nev., was proved false. The man was not Sands. He was much shorter, and he had a wooden leg. It was reported that new evidence as to the activities of the narcotic vendors, who are plentiful in Hollywood, had promised surprising developments, but there was nothing definite. The police were looking for a man said to be known as 'Dirty Joe,' who they believe can tell something about Taylor's personal habits, about the woman who went to call at his cozy bachelor apartments, when the shades had been drawn, and about the men reputed to be jealous of him. Some of the actors and actresses who have been patronizing this peddler are being sought, the police believing it possible they may talk 'if rightly handled.' Mary Miles Minter, the film star, who became hysterical when she heard of Taylor's death, has shut herself up in her home and four private detectives stand on guard to keep everybody away. Since it became known that Mary had written to Taylor, she will see nobody. A letter with her butterfly crest, signed, 'Yours, always, Mary,' was found in one of the numerous books in the Taylor library. 'Dearest,' it said, 'I love you, I love you, I love you.' There were nine little crosses for nine little kisses and the big cross with an exclamation point at the bottom of the letter. Mary has not admitted she sent this letter. Neither has she denied it. She has denied, however, that she loved Taylor in the sense the word is usually used. She loved him as a big, strong, kind man, she says, a brilliant, courteous, charming 'uncle.' She never was engaged to him. He never made love to her. Henry Peavey, Taylor's negro valet and cook, was questioned again today, but the only new thing he told was that Taylor kept a tiny lace handkerchief and that he used to kiss it often reverently. It may have been one sent him by his daughter, Ethel Daisy, who is coming to Los Angeles to attend the burial. It may have belonged to any one of many beautiful women. The handkerchief, so far as the police can learn, has nothing to do with the murder. But then, they say, neither has the missing pink silk nightie, for which they are still searching. The mystery of the nightie's disappearance simply adds to the mystery of the case. It was reported that the new county grand jury may be given this case within a few days. 'We are progressing with the case,' said Captain Adams, 'even if only by the process of elimination. We have not yet made any arrests, or taken anyone on suspicion, but we are gradually getting out of all the false trails that have been hiding the real path. I believe it all rests with Sands. Once we have him, we'll have everything.'...
1922-02-08	Declaring that he called William D. Taylor at 7:55 o'clock Wednesday night and, receiving no answer, went to the apartment of the film director, arriving there at 8:15 o'clock, rang the doorbell and still met with no response, Howard Fellows, chauffeur for the murdered director, last night definitely fixed the time within which the crime must have been committed and added facts regarding as of first magnitude importance in their bearing upon the crime. Strangely enough, this young man, who had been Taylor's driver for nearly six months, had not been questioned at length until yesterday, when an Examiner representative called on him at his home, 1622 Shatto Place. He is a brother of Harry Fellows, who was Taylor's assistant director. Yesterday Detective Sergeant Tom Zeigler took Howard to the Taylor home, 404-B South Alvarado street. He was partially identified by a resident of the neighborhood as the person he had seen seated in a car on the night of the murder near the scene of the crime and about the time it was committed. Fellows denied this and convinced Zeigler that the man was mistaken. One of Fellows' most interesting statements, other than that relating to his movements and observations on the night of the assassination, had to do with an alleged quarrel between Taylor and Mabel Normand. 'I was driving Mr. Taylor and Miss Normand from the Ambassador Hotel, where they had attended a New Year's Eve party, to her home.' said Fellows. 'On the way they had a quarrel. I don't know what it was about, but both were very much excited. 'Mr. Taylor took Miss Normand home and then returned to his apartment. Upon arriving there he broke down and wept. 'On the following morning he did up some jewelry in a package and took it to Miss Normand at her home.' Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored valet, confirms this. 'Mr. Taylor and Miss Normand were very affectionate,' continued Fellows. Questioned independently, Peavey said that Taylor often caressed her. As to these matters Fellows spoke casually, but when he entered upon the events of the night of February 1, his narrative became astounding both as to its content and because he had never told it before. 'I left the house (Mr. Taylor's) about 4:30 Wednesday afternoon,' Fellows began. 'Mr. Taylor told me he might be going out in the evening and instructed to be sure to telephone by 7:30. I went to the home of a young lady friend and was there until 7:55. I recall the time accurately because I had it on my mind to call Mr. Taylor and ask him if he would need the car. 'I called him two or three times before that hour, bur received no reply. I left the house of my girl friend at five minutes to eight and drove directly to Mr. Taylor's. 'I reached there about a quarter past eight. 'There was a light in the living room. I was surprised that Mr. Taylor should be home and not have answered the telephone. 'I rang the doorbell. Silence. I rang again. Still no response. I must have rung three or four times. Then I concluded: 'Well, he has some one there and doesn't want to answer.' 'So I put up the car. I was around back of the house, and it is peculiar that persons in the neighborhood should have heard me walking and not have heard me put up the car. I made a good deal of noise doing this, as the garage is difficult to get into, and I guess I must have backed the car up four or five times. 'I am satisfied that I am the man Mrs. Douglas MacLean saw standing on the porch and leaving the house. I wore a cap and a raincoat. 'I noticed no cars in the immediate vicinity and saw no one who aroused my suspicions. 'Naturally, I am convinced that both when I phoned and when I rang the doorbell, Mr. Taylor was lying there on the floor murdered.' Taking the testimony of Fellows and Miss Normand together, it is now possible to fix the time of the murder within fifteen minutes. Miss Normand said she left Taylor between 7:30 and 7:45 o'clock. Fellows called him at 7:55. The murder was committed between Miss Normand's leave-taking and Fellows' phoning. Hence, for the first time, the police have a picture of the murder as it relates to the time when and in which it was committed. Before Fellows' statement became available there was no conclusive evidence as to the time the bullet of the assassin struck the film director down. Testimony as to the shot being heard was so vague as to be unconvincing. It could not be said with finality that the murder did not occur at midnight or at any other hour of the night. The acts of the drama leading to the murder must have been brief. It would appear, indeed, that there were no preliminaries, that the intruder, concealed in the room, stepped out and fired the shot. It is therefore deduced that it was a premeditated crime and not one precipitated by a quarrel or any sort of scene more than of momentary duration. One group of police investigators and most of the deputy sheriffs working on the case are now convinced that the visit of Mabel Normand was the immediate antecedent occasion for the crime. This theory naturally takes for granted that Miss Normand had not the slightest intimation that her dear friend was to be shot to death, but officers cannot help but believe that the murderer found the way for his crime paved in some way by the visit of Miss Normand. There was another new angle to the case late yesterday upon which two of the ablest detectives on the force are now working. A citizen of established reputation gave the details to a high police official yesterday, the story running substantially as follows: A young man who has come into touch with motion picture people in a business way, though not one of them, was infatuated with an actress prominently mentioned in the investigation. Shortly before the time of the murder, that is between 7:30 and 8 o'clock on the night of February 1, this citizen saw the young man in question near Taylor's house. He wore a cap and a long coat. Since last Thursday he has not been seen either at his home or place of business. This clue is regarded as important because the elements of motive and time are supplied. The young man is said to have a violent temper and to have strongly resented innuendoes affecting the reputation of the actress whom he worshipped. Into the William D. Taylor murder last night was injected an element which the police regard as of startling import. This was the revelation, according to information, that a man's handkerchief, not the possession of Taylor himself, was found in the director's living room the morning after he was slain. The conclusion that the handkerchief did not belong to Taylor is furnished in this report-- It bore the initial 'S.' A detective is said to have picked up the article from the floor. He glanced at it, saw the initial, and for the moment, other matters engrossing him, he gave the discovery little thought. For several hours all was confusion in the Taylor rooms. Detectives, motion picture actors, reporters and photographers invaded the apartment. Yesterday the detective recalled the incident, remembering distinctly that there was a single initial embroidered on the square of linen. The disclosure proved to be of profound interest, as officers immediately started upon an investigation with this as the subject matter and the owner the end of the search. What gives the discovery special significance is that the handkerchief was soiled. So says the detective, who recalls this circumstance clearly. The handkerchief was lying on the floor near where Taylor's body lay outstretched. Now, Taylor, according to all the descriptions of him furnished by his friends, was a neat man and would not have had a soiled article like this lying around. To add to the probability that it came from without rather than from within the home, may be mentioned the fact that Henry Peavey, colored valet, had straightened up the director's living room before leaving for the evening. Peavey yesterday informed the police that the handkerchief certainly was not there when he left. He also stated that Taylor possessed nothing resembling this. Hence, it is a deduction that a man having a handkerchief bearing the initial 'S' called on Taylor and was in the apartment between the time Peavey left for the night and the discovery of the crime the following morning. In reconstructing the murder as suggested by this discovery the police picture the assassin as taking his handkerchief from his pocket during a conversation with Taylor and of so insecurely placing it back that it fell from his pocket. Or--and this is another sketch to fit the hypothesis--he may have used the handkerchief after the murder and, either in haste or agitation, dropped it. It is now of the utmost importance, in the view of the police, that this handkerchief be recovered. Or, failing in this, that its owner be identified. Some one took the article from the living room where it was carelessly placed by the detective who found it. Did that some one have an interest in hiding what might have been incriminating evidence? Its appearance, they say, would have precluded any mere souvenir hunter from having taken it. However, it is believed to be beyond question that some one surreptitiously picked this thing up and concealed it in his pocket. Whether or not it is of the huge possible importance with which it is now regarded, this new story has sent the police hunting in a new direction. They are looking for the owner of that handkerchief. A long list of film folk, celebrated and obscure, whose names begin with that initial, was being canvassed last night by officers. Little importance was attached to the pink silk nightgown found in the director's apartments. This, it was learned, had been laundered only once or twice and bore no initials or other marks by which its ownership might be determined. Information came to headquarters yesterday that a man had been seen walking back and forth in the rear of Taylor's home in the Westlake district about two weeks ago. He was seen there on at least two nights, pacing up and down the alley and, apparently, watching the house. There is, of course, no means of knowing who he was or why he was there, but the theory of a hired assassin enters to account for his presence and stealthy vigil. Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill yesterday started a systematic requestioning of all persons who might contribute helpful facts. One of those put down for a thorough course of grilling is an actress who has not been mentioned in the case. Officers called at her studio yesterday, but found that she was out on location at a distant point in Southern California. The collapse of a noted screen star mentioned frequently in connection with the case yesterday prevented the police from further questioning her. They had a point to clear up, and the information, it was learned, could only come from her. Her attorney yesterday took command of her affairs and notified callers that she was bedridden and in neither physical nor mental condition to discuss the case. The cause of the actress' breakdown is attributed in part to the strain of innumerable police interviews, but chiefly to the loss of a friend who, she says, was very dear to her. It developed yesterday that few members of the picture colony believe Edward F. Sands, discharged secretary-valet of the director, to have been the murderer. Particularly in the Famous Players-Lasky is this conviction strong. Few of them knew Sands personally, but those who had seen him around Taylor's apartments now recollect him as a man who might have been guilty of petty crimes, such as robbery, but not of murder. It occasioned little surprise yesterday when the sheriff of Elko, Nev., wired that the man seen there for several days and supposed to be Sands had been questioned and gave such a clear account of himself that the sheriff ordered his release. Detective Ed King this morning will ask the District Attorney for a complaint charging Sands with the murder of Taylor.
1922-02-08	Personal letters written by Mabel Normand, film actress to William Desmond Taylor, slain motion-picture director, were returned to her late yesterday, according to information in the possession of three officers working on the murder investigation. These missing letters, which have figured largely among the puzzling phases of the case, have never been in the hands of the police, it was declared. On suggestions of a thorough grand jury inquiry into the matter, the person said to have had these letters returned them to her, the three officers said. But a representative of Miss Normand, who collapsed yesterday at the funeral of the man whose home she left only a few minutes before he was shot in the back, stated she had not received them at a late hour last night. Captain of Detectives Adams asserted again that the police have never had any letters written by her or by Mary Miles Minter, another actress, whose love for Mr. Taylor has never been denied by her. These letters, couched in terms of endearment for the director, also were returned, according to the officers' report. Miss Minter, who has been ill, had no statement to make concerning the report. Her attorney said she did not have them... Deputy Sheriff Bell, working in connection with a 'lead' from Sheriff Traeger, made a mysterious trip during the afternoon and upon his return went into conference with Undersheriff Biscailuz and Superintendent of Criminal Investigation Manning. Mr. Biscailuz declined to divulge the nature of the inquiry, but declared he has every reason to believe they are on the right track and that the murder will not slip into the unsolved class. Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill spent the morning and part of the afternoon eliminating from serious consideration a 'tip' given Monday night by C. M. Meister, chauffeur for the Yellow Taxicab Company, who told the officers a lurid story of four persons and their mysterious activities near the scene of the murder on South Alvarado street last Wednesday night, the time the shooting occurred. Cato and Cahill declared yesterday they are convinced the episode mentioned has no bearing on the case, but they investigated it thoroughly before discarding it... Information tending to connect a motion-picture director, thus far not mentioned in any way with the official inquiry, with the mysterious slaying of Mr. Taylor in his bachelor apartments was received by two of the detectives late in the day. They left on a hurried trip which kept them away from the police station many hours. Although they were reticent about the new 'lead' it was learned they had discovered witnesses who related a quarrel asserted to have occurred, between Mr. Taylor and the new suspect. An Edward Sands, at first believed to be the man about whom the country- wide search has centered, was questioned for a considerable time yesterday by Detective Sergeants Herman Cline and Murphy. Mr. Sands, a young man whose description answered in a general way to that of the suspect, recently became captain of bellboys in a fashionable hotel. A letter addressed to him was noted, and since he had been employed at the hotel only a few days, someone's suspicions were aroused. Following the clue given them, the officers investigated. Mr. Sands gave a straightforward account of his whereabouts for the last few years and declared he did not know any Edward F. Sands. He explained that his middle name was Edward but that he always used it as a first name. In the hope that Mr. Sands might have known something of the family of the man wanted, the officers questioned him for an hour at the detective bureau. No information of value was obtained, it was stated. The Sheriff's office, which is conducting a complete inquiry into all clues received by the county officer holds the belief that Sands, who has been a fugitive from justice for many months because of asserted grand larceny and forgery, has no knowledge of the actual murder. Those officers, as well as some of those working out of the police detective bureau, adhere more closely than ever to the theory that Mr. Taylor, an outstanding figure in the motion-picture industry, was slain by a jealous rival for the love of a film actress...
1922-02-08	Los Angeles, Feb. 7--...Bell and Manning declare that the police theory, fixing the murder upon Sands, Taylor's former secretary, is erroneous. 'The man who killed Taylor is right here in Los Angeles,' declared Bell. 'We are not shooting blind. We know what and who we are after. Before another day is passed we will have action on the murder.' The county investigators are working on the theory that a woman is at the bottom of the mysterious murder. The chief evidence unearthed during the day is a letter and a bit of celluloid film. The letter was received by Arthur Koetchu, Assistant State's Attorney General. It was received from a woman and, according to Koetchu, has a direct bearing on the case. It recounted that the writer overheard a conversation at Second street and Bunker Hill avenue on the night of the tragedy. One of the motorists wore a cap and muffler, it was stated. The informant overheard the men conversing in low, excited tones, the letter states. 'Now that we're in for it,' one of them is said to have told 'the man in the muffler.' They separated, going in different directions in two automobiles. But the occupants lost some small articles in their haste, the letter states. One of these was a small strip of motion picture film, apparently part of a scenic reel depicting the Grand Canyon. In the strip was this sub-title, apparently only a sinister coincident: 'A deep and brooding mystery seems to hover over this great scar on the face of nature.' Taylor had several reels of pictures stored in his home. Detective George Conteres is going through them with Public Administrator Frank Bryson to ascertain whether or not the strip of film is part of Taylor's collection of scenics.
1922-02-08	Here is another unsigned love letter, in cipher, found in the effects of William D. Taylor, the motion picture director. This letter would indicate the writer's deep love for Taylor. The code is known to thousands of youngsters: 'What shall I call you, you wonderful man. You are standing on the lot, the idol of an adoring company. You have just come over and put your coat on my chair. I want to go away with you, up in the hills or anywhere just so we'd be alone--all alone. In a beautiful little woodland lodge you'd be cook (as I can only make tea) and fetch the water and build the fire. 'Wouldn't it be glorious to sit in a big comfy couch by a cozy warm fire with the wind whistling outside trying to harmonize with the faint sweet strains of music coming from our victrola. And then you'd have to get up and take off the record. Of course I don't really mean that, dear. Did you really suppose I intended you to take care of me like a baby? Oh, no, for this is my part, I'd sweep and dust (they make the sweetest little dust caps, you know) and tie fresh ribbons on the snowy white curtains and feed the birds and fix the flowers, and, oh, yes, set the table and help you wash the dishes and then in my spare time I'd darn your socks. I'd go to my room and put on something soft and flowing, then I'd lie on the couch and wait for you. I might fall asleep for a fire always makes me drowsy--then I'd wake to find two strong arms around me and two dear lips pressed on mine in a long sweet kiss---' (The last paragraph of this letter is being withheld by The Examiner from publication at this time.)
1922-02-08	Ten thousand persons paid final tribute to William Desmond Taylor yesterday afternoon. They stood with bared heads as the casket was removed from St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral, a solid, packed mass of humanity which extended from the church doors across Olive street, filled that thoroughfare from Fifth to Sixth streets, and overflowing into Pershing Square. A squad of police officers, under command of Sergeant J. A. McCaleb, including a number of mounted officers, had great difficulty in restraining the huge throng, and the famous picture stars who attended the service found themselves passing through a solid aisle of curiosity seekers, jostling and pushing each other in frantic efforts to catch a glimpse of the celebrities. Most of them, however, including Constance Talmadge, Mary Miles Minter and others came through a little used side door half an hour before the services, which began at 2 o'clock. Mabel Normand, escorted by several friends, hatted and furred so that her features were entirely obscured, came a few moments before the ceremonies. After the church, which has a seating capacity of 1000, was filled, the crowd stormed the doors in an effort to gain admittance, and it was only by using force that the police were able to restrain it. So great was the disturbance and the cries that, for a few moments, the service was interrupted. The great majority were women, and the crush became so great just before 2 o'clock that two women fainted and had to be removed in private automobiles. Every window in an adjoining house was packed; boys were perched on lamp posts, and across the street both men and boys were using trees and trolley posts to gain points of vantage. Never before in the history of Los Angeles has there been such a crowd at the funeral of a private citizen. The mounted officers kept open a path for street cars with difficulty and vehicular traffic was stopped by Sergt. McCaleb at 1 o'clock. They remained outside the house of worship, standing for three hours waiting to catch a glimpse of the casket and to see men and women whose names are known all around the world. All Screenland's notables sent floral pieces. The entire front of the chancel was a solid mass of blossoms which overflowed, almost to the alter in one direction, and down to the foot of the bier in another. Standing out prominently in bold relief against all the rest, was a huge, magnificent wreath of roses sent by Mabel Normand, which was on the left and a snow white cross of lilies with a card bearing the simple inscription: 'From Dustin.' There also was a modest shower of lilies, the flowers of purity, somewhat inconspicuous among the riot of American Beauties, orchids and other expensive blossoms. This card said merely: 'Ethel Daisy's' and was the contribution of Ethel Daisy Tanner, 19-year-old daughter of the dead man, whose home is in New York. While a list of the names on the cards attached to the floral pieces read like a page from the blue book of Filmdom, there was one, written in a rather scrawly hand, indicating it came from one in the humbler ranks, reading, simply: 'For Mr. Taylor--from Jim.' It was a basket of delicate Spring flowers. The Black Prince roses which Mary Miles Minter left at the mortuary, were there, as well as a gorgeous piece from the Directors' Association, of which the dead man was the president, and scores of others. Included in the number were flowers and pieces from the American Society of Cinematographers, a harp of pink roses, sweet peas and lilies, Charles Ray; shower of roses and lilies, from George Young and Helen Sanborn; Al Christie, red roses; Lila Lee, shower of pink roses; Mr. and Mrs. Thomas H. Ince, cross of pink roses and orchids; W. A. Robertson, shower of pink roses; Mack Sennett, basket of roses; E. M. and F. A. Franklin, showers of lilies; Antonio Moreno, wreath of lilies and orchids; Harry Fellows, assistant to Mr. Taylor, spring blossoms, sweat peas and lilies; Constance Talmadge, American Beauty roses, L. L. Burns, wreath of sweet peas, Charles Chaplin, wreath of velvet roses; Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean, spray of roses and lilies; from 'Bebe and Phyllis' a spray of pink carnations and lilies; Charles Levy and Sons, red velvet roses and lilies of the valley, Mr. and Mrs. R. Barker, wreath of pink roses and lilies of the valley; Edward Knoblock, wreath of sweet peas and lilies; shower of roses, Mrs. Otis Turner of New Rochelle, New York; Elsie A. Larson, roses; Ethel M. Davis, wreath, as well as large pieces from every organization identified with the film industry, including the Screen Writers' Guild, Actors' Equity Association and others. It was shortly after noon when the casket was placed at the head of the main aisle of the cathedral by Ivy H. Overholtzer, head of the mortuary from which bears his name. A deaconess in her semi-uniform of gray, was busy arranging the late floral tributes. A minister was tiptoeing about whispering and arranging final details. The air was heavy with the scent of roses, lilies and other flowers. Outside the February sun was shining brightly, with a hint of Spring in the air. A stray beam found its way through a bit of stained glass in a chancel window, which, strangely enough, bathed the bier in a mist of shimmering gold. The British flag, draped over the casket, was transmuted into a cloth of wondrous color and beauty. It was a scene of peace and quiet, yet pregnant with events soon to occur. Then came soft footfalls on the carpeted aisle and into a pew but a few feet away from the casket came Henry Peavey, colored cook and valet of the dead man, accompanied by J. J. Larkin, a white friend of many years standing. Peavey took one look at the masses of flowers, one glance at the gleaming cross on the altar, then his eye was caught and held by the flag- draped coffin, enwrapped in golden light. Suddenly he sobbed aloud, and, half turning his body, crumpled into a heap on the cushions, his body shaken with grief. It was almost half an hour before he could compose himself, and during the services tears ran unrestrained down his cheeks. Then came a sharp reminder of the days when the director abandoned the studio to battle for right, truth and justice, and became one of the five million men who helped turn the tide of war and bring victory. For Mr. Taylor enlisted as a private in the British army and rose to the rank of captain with remarkable rapidity. As a mute reminder of that service, his cap lay on the coffin, and he lay there in the casket in his uniform, but without the medals he won for valor and bravery. There was a sharp tread of feet, the rattle of arms, and short, sharp commands as a guard of honor was posted by the captain in command--Canadian soldiers, former service men, in full uniform, one at each corner, standing immobile, statue-like, with heads bowed, their hands resting on the butts of their rifles with barrels resting on the floor. And between the staccato orders of the captain came the sound of the sobs of Peavey, the servant of the dead man. It was half an hour before the time set for the rites that the half of the cathedral set aside for the film folks began to fill. Charles Eyton, general manager of the West Coast studios of the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, was among the first to come. He was followed by a number of directors almost as well known as their dead friend who lay in the casket in the front of the church, with four soldiers on guard--the honor guard for the dead British captain. Among the others who were present were George Melford, Ted Sloman, Wesley Ruggles, Frank Beall, Ben Wilson, Murdock MacQuarrie, James Young, Frank Campeau, Theodore Roberts, Antonio Moreno, Gilbert Hamilton, George L. Cox, Wallie Van, Paul Scardon, Roy Clements, Mrs. Julia Crawford Ivers, Mr. and Mrs. Henry McRae, Wallace Worsley, Kathleen Kirkham, Frank Lloyd, Joseph DeGrasse, Arthur Hoyt, Constance Talmadge, who was accompanied by her mother; James Neill and scores of others whose names are household words over the world. Among the throng was a little dark-haired, big-eyed girl whose eyes bore traces of weeping. She came in quietly with her mother and found as unobtrusive a seat as possible. She is Neva Gerber, former fiancee of Mr. Taylor, and, at the time of his death, one of his warmest friends and ardent admirers. Her handkerchief went often to her face during the services, as she was swept by memories of the tragedies, in sharp contrast to the happy hours they had spent planning a future wherein they should always be together. Outside the crowd had increased to large proportions. Sergeant McCaleb sent in a call for additional police to handle the impatient throng. A few of the fortunate ones who stood closest to the church door were admitted and it was announced the cathedral was closed. Then it was that the crowd broke the restraining ropes and the human barriers of soldiers and police and swept up the steps, determined to gain admission. There was a quick mobilizing of uniformed officers, attaches of the church and others who blocked the onslaught. They were compelled to handle some of the foremost and most aggressive men and women with force to prevent them from taking the edifice by storm. Some were people who had worked with Mr. Taylor; others came from various studios, but in the main they were idle curiosity seekers who possessed a morbid desire to be present at the services and to view the body later. They had waited from two to three hours and they were determined to get in at all costs. While the church was not completely full, this wholesale onslaught made it impossible to open the door and admit the few for whom there still was standing room. The organ began a slow, solemn dirge, as the crowd without was clamoring for admittance, and making so much noise those in the back could scarcely hear its notes. Dean William MacCormack, standing high in the pulpit, a dignified, commanding figure, was the center of attention. He gave a signal, and the male quartet ruffled its music, the organ switched into a prelude and then they sang the old, beloved hymn, which took many back to their childhood, and away for the moment, of the scenes of which they were apart. 'Lead, kindly light, amidst the encircling gloom. 'The night is dark and I am far from home. 'Lead Thou me on.' Their voices rose, clear and melodious and the swelling notes of the organ rose in accompaniment. To some this was but a prelude, but to most it brought recollections of days that are gone and friends who are no more. Of other churches, perhaps, at eventide, and other voices which sang this hymn--voices, like that of William Desmond Taylor, there in the casket, now stilled in death. When the last note died away, Dean MacCormack began reading the beautiful and impressive service of the Episcopal Church for the burial of the dead--the comforting words from the Book of books, which have come down through the years to lighten the sorrows of the bereaved, rich in promise and vibrant with hope. The clergyman made an impressive picture as he stood in the chancel in his vestments of white, reading the promises of the Man of Galilee, made 1900 years ago, which have brought their mede of cheer to countless millions: 'I am the resurrection and the Life; whosoever believeth in me shall not perish, but have everlasting life.' And those other pledges of eternal life and happiness. Then it seemed most fitting and proper that the quartet should sing another dearly beloved hymn, another heritage of the ages, 'Abide With Me'-- 'Abide with me. 'Fast falls the even tide. 'The darkness deepens. 'Lord with me abide.' Then there was the reading of Scripture by the Rev. C. H. Boddington, assistant to the dean, and the final prayer. Then the thousand persons in the church rose to their feet, again there was the sharp military commands as the guard of honor was changed, and, preceded by Dean MacCormack the casket was carried up the aisle and deposited in the vestibule of the cathedral. The throng within the church filed slowly out, stopping to take a last look at the slain director. And as they went slowly by Mabel Normand, in church pew, was in a state of collapse, but regained her composure later. She had planned to leave the edifice by a little used door, but abandoned the plan. The pall bearers, honorary and actual, were made up of members of the Motion Picture Directors' Association and those of the British Overseas Club, service men in uniform. Those from the directors' organization included James Young, Frank Beall, Frank Lloyd, D. M. Hartford, Joseph DeGrasse, Arthur Hoyt and Charles Eyton. The overseas contingent, which included the firing squad, was made up, in part, of the following: Major W. Driver, in command; Captains Morrie Spencer and J. Portus and Lieutenants Carter, Thompson, Donsell, Southern, Dalton, Jackson, Dickson and Rawlins. The firing squad was under command of Captain Arthur Clayton. A picturesque touch of color was lent to the otherwise drab scene by the presence of a company of Scotch bagpipers in full regalia, from caps to kilts and short stockings. There also was present, wearing a uniform unlike any of the rest, a bugler, furnished by the commander of the British warship Calcutta, now anchored at the port of Los Angeles. When the last of the spectators had left the cathedral, but with the outside crowd still increasing in numbers, the casket was born to the waiting hearse. There was a craning of necks and then the crowd surged forward completely blocking the passage way the police had made for the hearse and the funeral party. It was with difficulty that the bluecoats remade the path through the dense throng but it was finally accomplished and the funeral cortege started on its way. It moved slowly south on Olive street, the guard of honor, with arms reversed, followed by the pipers, playing a funeral march, the muffled drum forming a tonal background for the somewhat shrill skirling of the pipes. Traffic was halted on every cross street as the procession passed. On each side of the hearse walked the pallbearers, then came members of the Overseas Club in uniform, followed by the automobiles. In the first machine was Charles Eyton, William de Mille and a number of Lasky studio celebrities. A limousine immediately following was occupied by Mabel Normand The shades were closely drawn and the one star whose name has been more frequently mentioned in connection with the murder of Taylor was, with her party, hidden from the curious gaze of the thousands through which it passed. The next machine contained members of the Motion Picture Directors' Association, and the other noted members of the film colony. As the thin, high notes of the bagpipes called attention to the procession, pedestrians stopped and doffed their hats and gazed. Solid lines of humanity in the center of the street down to Ninth street, did not obstruct their vision. Men at work on a building on Olive street between Seventh and Eighth stopped their work and stood on ladders and the room, hats off, and watched the passing of the machines. Newsboys stopped selling their papers, with stories of the tragedy, to worm their way up to the front line of spectators in the street. Just as the cortege was between Seventh and Eighth streets, Henry Peavey ran across the street and climbed into an open car. Along the entire route the sidewalks were lined with people who paused and watched the solemn march. For nearly a mile on each side of Hollywood cemetery, where the final ceremonies were held, machines were parked. Along the drives of the cemetery hundreds of others were left, while their owners went to make up part of a throng of more than 1000 people. A square was roped off and around it this new crowd was waiting when the cortege arrived. The magnificent floral pieces had been set up and formed a fitting background for the last rites. And most prominent among them was the huge wreath sent by Mabel Normand. Also occupying an important position was the director's table at which he worked, and the canvas-backed chair in which he worked. The guard of honor drew up on one side. And then, there under the blue sky, with the green grass under foot, and palms waving gently in the afternoon breeze, the final words were said for the man who loved the open places of the world more than anything on earth. It seemed especially fitting and proper that the last tributes should be paid outdoors before his body was placed in a mausoleum. There was a prayer by the Dean, and then the Canadians took charge and the dead director was given a strictly military funeral. The spectators were permitted to view the body, after which three volleys were fired by the squad, and between each volley, the bagpipes sent forth their mournful refrain. Then the bugler placed his instrument to his lips and sounded 'taps,' the last call of the military day. The notes sounded through the lisnet city of the dead as the hundreds stood in hushed silence, and the last mark of respect and love had been paid the dead director.
1922-02-08	Mary Miles Minter today was closely guarded by private detectives whom she had stationed at her beautiful Spanish casita, 2039 North Hobart boulevard, to keep away reporters and the merely curious. Miss Minter, according to reports from her house, is in a very nervous condition and has not been able to sleep for two nights. She was in conference with her mother, several friends and her attorney, John R. Mott. Expensive limousines lined the street for half a block. All correspondents who attempted to gain admission were turned back by the guards.
1922-02-08	...A fight to save the professional reputation of Mary Miles Minter, movie star, whose name has been dragged into the William D. Taylor murder mystery, was started today by her friends here. Hollywood's financiers, dealt a severe blow in the Arbuckle case, are resolved that no more screen prestige in which thousands of dollars have been invested shall be lost. Magnates determined to preserve Miss Minter's screen popularity met with attorneys at her home. Behind drawn curtains while private detectives stood guard to keep outsiders away the conference continued during the night and up until and early hour this morning... The son of a multi-millionaire eastern family may be arrested in connection with the murder of Taylor within the next day or two. His arrest will occur if county detectives can find a few necessary bits of corroborative evidence to support the theory already partly borne out by recent discoveries. The man who is suspected of knowing something about the mysterious assassination of the prominent picture director is now in Los Angeles under close surveillance. He came to this city, according to report, because of his admiration of a certain prominent woman movie star, whose name is among those mentioned as friends of the dead director. He was accredited by mutual acquaintances with being insanely jealous of the girl, although she, it appears, had never given him very much encouragement. Matrimony was his object, it is believed. Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz confirmed the supposition that the sheriff's office is working on the theory that the murder was committed by some admirer of an actress and not by Edward F. Sands, former secretary of Taylor. Captain David L. Adams, head of the police detective squad that is trying to solve the murder, still hold firmly to the theory that with the capture of Sands the murder will be explained. Police are concentrating on the task of finding the secretary...
1922-02-08	A conspiracy of silence intended to thwart police investigation; the assurance of immunity for Edward F. Sands on a felony charge; the asserted career of the alleged slayer; entry of the federal government into the probe; the grilling of witnesses and the widespread probing of new and secret evidence featured developments in the mystery surrounding the slaying of William D. Taylor today... Sands, the man whom Police Captain David L. Adams is confident is responsible for the slaying of Taylor, today invited the fugitive to communicate with police headquarters and eliminate himself from the case if he is not guilty. 'Sands will not be prosecuted on the grand larceny charge now pending against him,' Captain Adams said. 'He can't be. The complaining witness in that case--Taylor--is dead. That case could never come to trial. 'If Sands is innocent, all he has to do is to notify me and prove his whereabouts on the night of the murder. If he can explain his movements successfully he will be released. We don't want him...' That there is an apparent plot afoot to prevent the true facts in the case from coming to light was corroborated today by Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz. 'To date practically every source of possible information has proved a blank wall as far as the investigation is concerned,' he said. 'Plenty of red- hot information has been obtained by this office, but it has been wormed and ferreted out from various sources where it should have been forthcoming from persons who know. 'There is to be no further patience shown these persons who have been extended every courtesy and given every opportunity to tell what they know. Those who have facts which should be known to this office must 'come clean.' Sheriff Traeger will brook no more of these petty delays and unwillingness on the part of those who apparently have reached a unanimous decision to thwart the efforts of officers of the law interested in seeing that justice be done.'... It seemed today that activities for the time being would center at county headquarters where, under the personal direction of Sheriff William I. Traeger, Deputies Al Manning and Harvey Bell are working night and day in their efforts to bring the slayer to justice. Three men have been under suspicion by these officers for the past two days. One of them may be arrested today. It was definitely stated by the sheriff's office that steps would be taken to charge one of them with complicity, at least, in the crime. This assertion dovetails with intimation that Taylor was the victim of a sinister plot in which many persons well known to the public are more or less involved. It is whispered that before the investigation is concluded a startling list of names will be bandied about as co-conspirators in the slaying of the noted director. Shortly after 9 o'clock deputies were dispatched to look for the one of the trio said to have full knowledge of the murder and to collect further evidence relative to the asserted conspiracy... Sand's connection with the case has proved the bone of contention between various officials working on the mystery. The police department, practically to a man, are inclined to believe him guilty of the murder. Representatives of the sheriff's office take a diametrically opposite view. There is nothing in the evidence thus far disclosed which would connect the former secretary with the crime, they say. But Chief Deputy District Attorney William C. Doran is of the opinion Sands is the man and as a result a formal complaint charging him with the crime may be issued today. The district attorney's office has Detective Sergeants Contreras and King working on the case since it was first opened and they are in possession of certain facts that warrant such procedure, they say. All of the officers working on the case, however, are proceeding with 'open' minds and are accepting each clue at its face value. They were also busy today searching for a new figure in the tangle--a man said to have been deeply in love with a prominent motion picture actress mentioned in connection with the case. This man was seen in the vicinity of the Taylor home a few days prior to the murder and is said to be similar in build and general appearance to the man seen lurking about the Alvarado street residence on the night of the slaying. The 'mystery woman' interjected into the case late yesterday at the sheriff's office was also scheduled to make a second appearance today. Her identity has been closely guarded and the nature of her testimony has been withheld. According to Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz, however, she is of the 'utmost importance' to the ultimate unraveling of the mystery...
1922-02-08	FILM STAR FAINTS AT TAYLOR FUNERAL; SANDS IS ACCUSED Miss Normand Weeps as women Shriek in Rush to Enter Disturb Rites. THOUSANDS STORM CHURCH Love Letter on Mary Miles Minter's Stationery is Found' by Police in a Book. SHE ADMITS SHE LOVED HIM Dead Man's Butier, it is Announced, Will Be Charged Today With His Murder. Special to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb 7.-Sweeping the police aside crowds stormed the doors of St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral today in an effort to force an entrance when the funeral services were being held for William Desmond Taylor. Several women were overcome in the crush and were removed with difficulty. The police succeeded in closing the doors after a battle with the crowds, but the cries of the women, caught in the onrush, penetrated the church and were heard above the words of Dean William MacCormack, who was officiating. Mabel Normand, weeping and appearently on the verge of collapse, arrived at the church just before the funeral services began supported by her maid and a woman friend. She was escorted through the crowd by a detective, After the services were over Miss Normand fainted in the church. Friends rushed to her side and sought to revive her. Later, efforts were made to hurry her out of the church, but these attempts were abandoned because of the crowd, and she remained in the church until she was fully composed. Edward F. Sands will be charged with the murder of Taylor in a complaint to be issued tomorrow according to a statement tonight by Detective Sergeant King, who said that the case is now solved. He promises soon to unfold the "new "and concliusive" evidence upon which the complaint is based. Six thousand persons, it was estimated, were packed into Olive Street at the hour for the funeral service, The crowd overflowed the street and occupied part of Pershing Square across. Many police were sent to keep the crowd in hand, but their efforts were vain in the face of the determination of the onlookers to get a view of the funeral. British Flag Drapes Coffin. The coffin was draped with a British flag, the flag under which Taylor fought during the Worid War. In the aisle were an old table and chair which Tayfor had used at the studio. The top of the table was covered with violets. Half of the church was roped off for members of the motion picture professsion and close friends of the slain director, while the other half was open to the public. Floral offerings from Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, Wallace Reid, Thomas Meighan, Agnes Ayers. Jack Holt, Bebe Daniels, Wanda Hawley, Dorothy Dalton, Betty Compton, Dougas MacLean and other film actors and actresses were banked about the casket. Miss Normand sent a carpet of American Beauty roses for the coffin to rest upon. while Miss Mary Miles Minter sent Black Prince roses. The pallbearers, chosen from Mr, Taylor's personal friends, included William De Mille, Frank Beal, George Melford, Arthur Hoyt, James Young, Frank Lloyd, David Hartford and, Charles Eyton. An honorary guard of pallbearers from the Overseas Club assisted at the close of the service. Henry Peavey, Taylors negro servant, on seeing the dead body of his master in the coffin, became hysterical and had to be taken back into the church and quleted as the coffin left the church. The mystery of the missing hour in the last day of Taylor's life has been accounted for. That hour was between 5 and 6 P. M., two hours before he was killed. Henry Peavey, the colored valet, stated that Taylor had left the house at 5 P. M., after announcing that he was going for a walk. He left instruction with Peavey to inform Miss Normand if she called that he would return at 6 P. M. He returned at that hour. He was taking a dancing lesson. A Mrs. Waybright was his instructor. "He was just brushing up on some of the old steps," Mrs. Waybright stated." He had always taken private lessons. His previous lesson was taken continued on Page Six.  FILM STAR FAINTS AT TAYLOR FUNERAL continued from Page I, Column 3. on the preceding Monday night. Om Wednesday night I noticed nothing unusual about his actions. He was  as jolly, though as quiet and reticent, as on the preceding visit. He never discussed his personal affairs with me while we danced. We only talked of his progress in dancing. Had there been any worry on his mind on his last visit I would have noticed it. Handkerchief as a Clue. LOS ANGELES, Feb. 7 (Associated Press). The announcement tonight that Edward F. Sands would be formally charged with William Desmond Taylor's murder followed the revelation that a detective was said to have found a handkerchief with the letter "S" embroidered on it near the body of Taylor. Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored servant, said his employer had no such possession and that he was certain such a handkerchief was not on the floor of the apartment when he left it shortly before the time fixed as that of the murder last Wednesday night. Earlier in the day the police issued a circular calling for Sands's arrest. Secretary and butler to Taylor. The circular was ordered forwarded to all police departments of the country. It contained a picture of Sands, declared by Captain of Detectives David L. Adams to be the only one in existence, so far as the police have been able to learn. At the same time Captain Adams declared that Sands was the only person whose arrest the police were seeking in connection with the case. The circular read as follows: "We hold warrants on charges of grand larceny felonies for the arrest of Edward F. Sands. We have also burglary charges against him and seek him for the murder of William Desmond Taylor in this city of Los Angeles on the evening of Feb. 1, 1922. "Description: Edward F. Sands American or English birth; has been known to give his name as W. D. of William D. Tanner; is believed to have  also used the name of Edward Fitz Strathmore, He is about 36 years of age, eight 8 feet 7 or 8 inches, heavily built; some months ago welghed 185 to 195 pounds or more, but is said to be lighter now; present weight may not be more than 175; round, full face, light complexion: very heavy brown hair: rather heavy eyebrows, said by some to almost meet over his nose: short nose, peculiar mouth, which looks small when closed; smokes cigarettes: usually well dressed; is well educated: fine penman, good accountant: is said to have served in the United States Navy. The charges of grand larceny and burglary were preferred by Taylor, who told the police that Sands disappeared with money and other valuables about six months ago, and later returned and stole other articles from his apartments. The police also learned that the person who robbed the apartments returneda pawn ticket to Taylor showing he had disposed of some of the articles, giving the name "William Deane Tanner." Taylor was formerly known as  "William Cunningham Deane Tanner," which fact, the police assume, was known to Sands. Arthur Keetch, Assistant State Attorney General, turned over today to Disstrict Attorney Lee C. Woolwine a letter in which the writer related an incident the night Taylor was murdered.  The writer whose name is not told, stated that his attention had been attracted to four men in two automobiles at Second Street and Bunker Hill Avenue. The cars were standing at the corner. One of the men was heard to exclaim. "Now that we've got him, we'll have to run like h--l." Youth Is Examined. An incident of the day in the search for Sands was the bringing to Police Headquarters of a youth of that name who turned out to be a bellboy in an apartment house, who soon convinced the police that he was not the man wanted. Another "Sands" was reported located in Carlin, Nev., but the officials in that section reported this was also a false clue. Deputies under Sheriff William L. Traeger said they were working on "several pressing angles" in connection with the case and were "very far from being discouraged." They said they had not taken part in the search for Sands, leaving that to the police. A scented note dropped from one of Taylor's books while police detectives were making an examination of his effects, according to The Los Angeles Examiner. It was on the butterfly monogramed stationery of Mary Miles Minter. It read as follows:  Dearest " I love youI love youI love you. "XXXXXXXX "Yours always, MARY." The last "X" was two inches in height followed by an exclamation point an inch in height. Mary Miles Minter did not deny authorship of the letter, according to The Examiner. "I did love William Taylor," she said. "I loved him deeply and tenderly with all the admiration and respect a young girl gives to a man with the poise and culture of Mr Taylor." Taylor and Miss Minter met at Santa Barbara two years ago. He was her director in several pictures. Letters Are written in Code. Among Taylor's effects were found two letters written in a well-known school girl code of straight lines and dots. One of these, deciphered, reads as follows: "I love you oh, I love you. "I had to come down because mama remarked that I always seemed to feel rather happy after being out with you. So here I am camouflage. "Furthermore, I am feeling unusually fine more camouflage. "I will see you later. God love you as I do." The home of Mary Miles Minter was under a heavy guard of private detectives today, and none but those with official permission were permitted to enter the grounds or residence. No explanation of their presence was made by the detectives, who maintained silence when questioned as to the purpose or by whom they were detailed to guard the place. In their consideration of blackmail as a possible element in the murder of William Desmond Taylor the police recalled tonight that Miss Normand was the intended victim of an alleged blackmailing plot several years ago. In 1916, she caused the arrest of Dr. Raymond A. Swett, a dentist, now said to be dead. It was charged that Swett demanded $610 from the actress under the alternative that he would circulate stories to her discredit. It is understood that Miss Normand dropped the matter upon receipt of a note from Swett, asking leniency because of his wife and children. Friends of Taylor told the police that the Director had an intense hatred for blackmailers. They quoted him as having said: "There is only one way to treat the blackmailer. Kill him." DON COLLINS Is ARRESTED.  Man Mentioned in Taylor Murder Is Located in Miami. Inspector John D. Coughlin, head of the Detective Division, received a telegram late yesterday afternoon from the police of Miami, Fla., informing him of the arrest there of Don Collins, exconvict and Tenderloin habitue, whose name was mentioned in connection with the slaying of William Desmond Taylor the motion-picture director, in Los Angeles. The telegram stated, he said, that Collins was in the company of another man and Miss Lila Wiley. 23 years old, who formerly lived with her parents at his Mount Hope Place, the Bronx. He added that he was under the impression that the second man was Francis T. Boylan, who formerly lived in the Hotel Claridge here. Collins was sought by the police of this city on an indictment charging him with shooting John H. Reid, a manufacturer of sllk lingerie, in the home of Mrs. Hazel Davis Warner, a cousin of Miss Wiley, at 1,892 University Avenue, the Bronx, on May 15 last. Collins was alledged to have fled with Boylan and Miss Wiley after he had shot Reid five times. About a week after the shooting Miss Wiley and Boylan surrendered to district Attorney Edward J. Glennon in the Bronx, were held in $10,000 bail each as material witnesses by Judge Gibbs in the Bronx County Court and later appeared before the Grand Jury in the investigation which resulted in Collins's indictment. Mrs. Warner was also placed under $10,000 bail as a witness. Reid, who at the time said he lived at 66 West Forty-sixth Street, recovered  from his wounds, but was reported to have proved of little aid to the District Attorney in his investigation of the shooting. The police never established a motive for the shooting of the manufacturer, but learned that Collins came into Mrs. Davis' home while she and Miss Wiley were entertaining Reid and Boylan. There was no mention of the killing of Taylor in the telegram, said Inspector Coughlin. DEFENDS MOVIE COLONY. Carl Laemmle Declares Hollywood Is Clean and Beautiful. Carl Laemmle, President of the Universal Film Manufacturing company issued a statement yesterday replying to one made Sunday by Herbert Brenon, a producing manager, in which Mr. Brenon said that Hollywood must be abolished because of the recent scandals in the California motion-picture colony. Mr. Laemmle's statement says: "Mr. Brenon has given out a good story. My chief criticism of it is that what he said, if he said it, is nonsense. Hollywood is not a nest of immoral people. Living there does not harm one's morals any more than living in New York or London or Paris or San Francisco or any other live centre. It is a clean, beautiful place, and it does not even need as much defense as I have given it. Of course, it has its bad element. Show me a place that hasn't. "To say that the Taylor murder hurts the moving-picture business is utterly foolish. If it turns out that a banker committed the murder, it wont hurt the banking business, will it? Nor will it hurt the newspaper business if an editor committed the crime. Nor will it hurt any other business if some one from that particular business killed Mr. Taylor. Then why should it damn the moving-picture business if it turns out that some one connected with a studio fired the fatal shot? "The movies are a popular target. Nearly everything has been blamed on them except the big wetness of Noah's time. I can't see how the Taylor murder will furnish any ammunition for reformers just because a man in the business has been murdered. I have no doubt that police records almost anywhere will show that in times gone by reformers themselves have even been murdered, but that is hardly a reflection on reformers as a whole. "The picture business has helped Hollywood to become one of the most thriving cities in the world. Less than two years ago I could have bought a piece of property there for $40,000. Recently it was sold for $120,000. Immorality never did that.   
1922-02-08	Nevada Sheriff Satisfied Prisoner Is Not Sands   Eiko, New., Feb. I (By the Associated Press. F.

February 9, 1922 FILM STAR FAINTS AT TAYLOR FUNERAL   Mabel Normand Shrieks and Falis to Floor as She Looks. at the Dead.   SHOUTS DISTURB SERVICE Crowd of 30,000 Struggles to Get Into Church--Bagpipes Play Dirge in Military Rites.   Los Angeles, Feb. 7 (By the Associated Press)--Laughter and sereams and prayers marked the funeral here today of William Desmond Taylor, murdered motion-picture director. A crowd estimated by the police to number 30,000--almost ten times as many as could be seated in St. Paul' s Episcopal pro-cathedral--fought for admittance, and when that was denied to the majority, those left on the outside of the structure jammed the streets and overflowed Pershing square, a small downtown park, upon which the pro-cathedral faces. Many women in the crowd outside fainted. Within the darkened procathedral only one fainted. She was Mabel Normand, who was attired in deep mourning. and who is one of the last to have seen the dead director alive.   Union Jack on Casket. The casket draped with the Union Jack and topped by Taylor's army cap, stood before the altar. Taylor's body was dressed in the uniform of an officer in the British army, with which he served during the world war. Four uniformed British veterans  guarded the casket, which was banked with scores of massive floral pieces. Half of the seats were given over to persons of the film colony and half to the general public. On one side of the casket sat members of the motion picture director 's association, of which Taylor had been president. Stars and producers were scattered here and there. They included Cecil de Mille, Thomas R. Incc, Dustin Farnum, Douglas MacLean and Antonio Moreno. While the Rev. William McCormack, of St. Paul's, was reading the burial service, shouts and laughter from the jostling, hysterical, riotous throng without echoed through the procathedral.   Miss Normand Collapses. Miss Normand had sat within a few feet of the casket. During the service she fixed her eyes upon it, occasionally sobbing and clasping the hand of a woman companion. Supported on the arms of the two women, she was the last of the long line to file past the casket for a last look at the dead director. She gave a quick glance, cried out, staggered a few paces and fell to the floor in a faint. She was carried into the ves try room, revived and taken home. When the funeral cortege moved away from the procathedral it was led by a group of Scotch bagpipe players, playing a shrill dirge. Beside the hearse marched a squad of men in the British army uniform, the honorary pallbearers. The active pallbearers, members of the motionpicture directors association, rode. Back of the honorary pallbearers marched about 50 members of the British Overseas club, veterans of the world war. Later in the line came 100 or more crowded automobiles. At the cemetery there was a brief service and he body was placed in a vault. 
1922-02-08	ORDER SANDS' ARREST   Police Send Out Picture of Film  Director's Butler. CALL NEW CLEW CONCLUSIVE   Love Note From Mary Miles Minter Found in Slain Man's Book. Motion Picture Actress Goes Into Seclusion and Residence Guarded to Insure Privacy--Affectionate Letters, in Schoolgirl Code, Also Discovered--Wealthy New Yorker  Is Eliminated by the Detectives.   (By the Associated Press.) Los Angeles, Feb. 7.--A complaint charging Edward F. Sands, alias Edward Fitz Strathmore, missing butlersecretary, with the murder of his former employer, William Desmond Tayfor, will be issued, it was declared tonight, by Detective Sergt. Edward  King, of the police department. The complaint will be based on "new and conclusive" evidence uncovered today, according to King. Sands is now a fugitive from justice, as charges of grand larceny and burglary, preferred against him by Taylor, never have been dismissed. It was said that the new complaint might be issued against him tomorrow. Guards remained on duty tonight about the home of Mary Miles Minter, who admitted today she was the writer of a letter to Taylor. The  guards were employed to protect the actress against uninvited callers.   Nation-wide Search Started. Today's investigation of the slaying of Taylor culminated in the issuance by the police of a circular asking the arrest of Sands. The circular was ordered forwarded to all police departments of the country. It contained a picture of Sands, declared by Captain of Detectives David Adams to be the only one in existence, so far as the police have been able to learn. At the same time Capt. Adams declared that Sands was the only person whose arrest the police were seeking in con nection with the case. “There has been abundant surmise about other individuals," he said, "and we have run down countless clews relating to the murder. But  I can say positively that we have no leads that would warrant us seeking anyone but Sands."   Text of Circular. The circular read as follows: "We hold warrants on charges of  grand larceny felonies for the arrest of Edward F. Sands. We have also burglary charges against him and seek him for the murder of William Desmond Taylor in this city of Los  Angeles on the evening of February 1, 1922. Description: Edward P. Sands, American or English birth. Has been known to give his name as W. D. or William Deane Tanner. Is believed to have also used the name of Edward Fitz-Strathmore. He is about 28 years of age; height, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches; heavy built; some months ago weighed 185 to 195 pounds or more, but is said to be lighter now; present weight may not be more than 175; round, full face, light complexion, very heavy brown hair; rather heavy eyebrows, said by some to almost meet over his nose; short nose; peculiar mouth which looks small when closed; smokes cigarettes; usually well dressed; is well educated; fine penman; good accountant, is said to have served in the United States navy." The charges of grand larceny and burglary were preferred by Taylor, who told the police that Sands disappeared with money and other valuables about six months ago, and later returned and stole other articles from his apartments. The police also learned that the person who robbed the apartments returned a pawn ticket to Taylor, showing he had disposed of some of the articles, giving the name "William Deane Tanner." Taylor was formerly known as "William Cunningham Deane Tanner," which fact the police assume, was known to Sands.   Two False Clews. An incident of the day in the search for Sands was the bringing to police headquarters of a youth of that name who turned out to be a bell boy in an apartment house, who soon convinced the officers he was not the man wanted. Another "Sands" was reported located in Carlin, Nev., but officials in that section reported this was also a false clew. Deputies working under Sheriff William I. Traeger said they were working on "several pressing angles" in connection with the case and were "very far from being discouraged." They said they had not taken part in the search for Sands, leaving that to the police. They declined to state whether any importance was to be attached to a visit to the sheriff's office of a woman whose identity was kept secret. After being interrogated she was hurried away in an automobile. Persons who caught a glimpse of her declared she was not any one of prominence in motion picture circles. "A scented note dropped from one of Taylor's books while police dedetectives were making an examination of his effects, according to the Los Angeles Examiner.  It was on the butterfly monogrammed stationery of Mary Miles Minter. It read as follows: "Dearest--I love you-I love youI love you.   x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x "Yours always, MARY."   The last "x" was two inches in height, followed by an exclamation point an inch in height. Mary Miles Minter did not deny authorship of the letter, according to the Examiner. "I did love William Taylor," she said "I loved him deeply and tenderly, with all the admiration and respect a young girl gives to a man with the poise and culture of Mr. Taylor." Taylor and Miss Minter met at Santa Barbara two years ago. He was her director. They later went to New York with the company. The wealthy young New York man, who was reported to have left Los Angeles on the day following the murder of Taylor and who was enamored of one of the motion picture actresses whom police have been questioning in connection with the case, was located late last night by private detectives. According to these investigators he gave an account of himself which they say practically eliminates him from consideration in connection with the case. He was loeated in a downtown hotel. Interest had centered upon him for several days because he was said to be a rejected suitor of an actress reported infatuated with Taylor. Among Taylor's effects were found two letters written in a well-known school girl code of straight lines and dots. One of these deciphered reads as follows:   Happier After Meetings. "I love you-oh, I love you. "I had to come down because mamma remarked that I always 'seemed to feel rather happy after being out with you.' So here I am. Camouflage. Furthermore I am feeling unusually fine-more camouflage. "I will see you later. God love you as I do." An attorney for Miss Minter announced she had gone into seclusion and the residence was guarded by friends at the request of the family to insure privacy. The attorney said in connection with a letter published today as from Miss Minter to Taylor that it is possible the motion picture actress may issue a statement.  
1922-02-09	William Desmond Taylor was called 'the love wizard' by dope-haunted members of the Hollywood film colony.
1922-02-09	Magazines devoted to motion picture plays and players do a great deal of harm by the nauseating drivel that they print. The silly prattle that is put into the mouths of screen players who are 'interviewed' for these magazines and then pen pictures drawn of them are beyond reason. Rex Ingram, a scholar, is not given any better 'boost' than a former salesgirl who has suddenly become a headliner. The same superlatives that are used to discuss Ingram are used to describe the brainless cutie whose face is her fortune and whose brain is still in the kindergarten age. It is a long jump from paperbound novels and chewing gum to Plato and Thoreau, but the facile writer of the screen monthlies blithely makes this leap. It must have been with pain and anguish that the screen fans read how Mabel Normand, pictured as a devotee of Voltaire and Nietzsche, testified that on her way to William Taylor's house on the fatal night she stopped at a newstand to buy a bag of peanuts and a copy of the POLICE GAZETTE.
1922-02-09	Proceedings at the funeral of a murder victim indicate that there are at least 30,000 unemployed in Los Angeles.
1922-02-09	Hollywood Up In Arms At Frank Mayo An avalanche of indignation followed today in the wake of the statement credited to Frank Mayo, film actor, in a New York dispatch yesterday, in which the Hollywood motion picture colony was severely criticized. Publication of Mayo's interview brought instant protest. The actor's ears must have 'burned' continually since yesterday if the superstition holds good, for all Hollywood 'panned' him unmercifully. For the moment he was as big a subject for conversation as was the Taylor murder. Mayo's unexpected attack on the Hollywood motion picture colony was described as 'ravings' and 'an example of the lengths to which some notoriety- seeking individuals will go to get their name in the paper.' Scores of picture celebrities and studio executives strongly condemn Mayo's act. At every studio protests were heard. Mayo recently figured in a sensational divorce suit. As one prominent star put it, 'Persons who live in glass houses should not throw stones.'
1922-02-09	Psychics Seek Solution of Murder While police, sheriff's deputies and district attorney's detectives are following every earthly clue in the endeavor to track down the mysterious person who murdered William D. Taylor in his Alvarado street apartment, the psychical research societies and the spiritualistic devotees of Los Angeles are seeking through the invisible lanes of the supernatural to establish communication with the slain man on the 'other side.' Friends of Mr. Taylor say that he was a devout believer in the ability of spirits of the departed to manifest themselves to those still occupying their earthly bodies. 'When I go into the great adventure,' he is quoted as having said, 'I will use every effort that is possible on the 'other side' to get back into communication with those remaining on earth,' and it is with the belief that Taylor's spirit will retain the power to carry out this promise that the psychics and spiritualists of Los Angeles are centralizing their efforts upon the attempt to get into communication with him. These devotees of the occult firmly believe that it is possible for this to be done and they hold it would prove a tremendous proof of the truth of their beliefs if through spirit means a solution of the baffling death mystery could be worked out. Thus far, however, they freely admit that nothing definite has been obtained from their concerted efforts. This difficulty is being explained away by the psychics by the statement that in cases of sudden death, such as that of Mr. Taylor, the resultant mental shock and confusion of the instant is liable to last some little time after the death of the body and the spirit is very apt to linger around the old home, trying to adjust itself to the more familiar physical surroundings. According to their beliefs there is a very definite reason why word is not easily obtained from the unseen when related to the commission of a crime, and that is that as such information is invariably subject to the laws of destiny, not fate. According to this law, they say, the whole tape of experience must unravel itself in its own sequence, just as the flower exposes its true nature in its complete unfolding. The fundamental laws upon which these psychics say that they will base their efforts for communication are exactly the same as those which govern the underlying principle of wireless telegraphy. Some of the most noted psychics of the city have expressed the keenest interest in the effort and will try to secure what they term 'dependable communications' from the deceased motion picture director through one of their centers and from some one of the spiritual planes. Authorities claim that the conditions for the success of such a communication are more favorable now than ever before, since a certain cycle which has passed seems to have materially thinned the intervening veil. Many will await with interest the outcome of this widely organized effort.
1922-02-09	(Los Angeles)--The dynamic energy of the police in the fruitless search for the solution of the mysterious murder of William Desmond Taylor was exceeded today by the massed and hurricane activity of the kings of the film industry to ring down the curtain on the unceasing flow of scandal that has surrounded the tragedy. The police centered their search on meager clues that ended in blind alleys--mysterious pink nighties that disappear--initialed handkerchiefs that cannot be found--hints of secret loves of beautiful and unnamed women stars-- rejected lovers--scented love letters-- The chain is endless. Throughout Hollywood the great men of the industry were closeted with men and women idols of the screen, making every effort to hush up the scandal. Giddy parties in the fast road house resorts have been cancelled. The lights of the white light cabarets no longer shine on decolleted and shimmy loving women of the screen.
1922-02-09	...Information in the hands of police detectives indicates that Sands was near the scene of the crime about the time of the shooting, which is officially believed to have been about 7:50 or 7:55 p.m. a week ago yesterday. He also has been reported from reliable sources to have been in Los Angeles both before and after that day.
1922-02-09	...Several of the officers adhere closely to the theory that Sands, inspired by hate and a desire for revenge upon the man who caused him to be a fugitive from justice, slipped into the Taylor home and shot down his former employer...The officers who believe Sands committed the murder hold the opinion that he is insane, or at least mentally unbalanced because of his troubles, and believe many of his actions can be accounted for in this way.
1922-02-09	I am still clinging to my original theory of the crime--that the man with the cap whom my maid saw loitering in the alleyway the night of the murder slipped into Mr. Taylor's apartments when he escorted Mabel Normand to her motor and shot him immediately after he had returned to his suite and closed the door behind him.' Such was the assertion today of pretty little Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of the famous screen star, and whose apartment in the court at 400 South Alvarado street diagonally faces that of the slain cinema director, William Desmond Taylor. According to Mrs. MacLean, in the three years Taylor had occupied the apartment at 404-B South Alvarado, he had only entertained a few times, living on the whole a quiet and secluded existence and visited only by his intimate circle of friends. 'It seemed strange to see them moving Mr. Taylor's belongings today,' said Mrs. MacLean. 'He was certainly an ideal neighbor in every respect. Mr. MacLean and myself used to frequently see men visitors go to his apartments and now and again we would hear the familiar voice of some celebrated star chatting outside on his steps. 'But he never gave any wild parties--indeed, he never gave any other kind, either, but seemed to enjoy best simple amusements. 'It seems perfect plausible to me that the murderer could have slipped into Mr. Taylor's apartments during those few minutes when we all know he was escorting Miss Normand to her waiting motor car. Mr. MacLean and myself discovered that it would have been possible for the man whom my maid reported as loitering in the alleyway to have kept watch on Mr. Taylor's front doorway from where he was standing. 'My maid declared that the man was unusually still and silent for a loiterer. I suppose that I undoubtedly saw the murderer as he left Mr. Taylor's apartments that night. But it was dark and I couldn't see his face at all. 'According to my theory the man who killed Mr. Taylor was crouched back of the door, by the wall, and so was not discovered until after the door had been closed by Mr. Taylor. Then I believe that the man shot almost immediately. 'Mr. MacLean and myself are certain that we heard the shot and Mr. Jessurun, the manager, who has the adjoining apartment, also heard the report. But you know how little attention one pays to such noises-- especially when they are not repeated. We supposed it was a motor car and let it go at that. 'But I think that every one in any way affiliated with the motion picture industry is determined never to give up the trail until the slayer is apprehended.'
1922-02-09	Army records and papers found yesterday in the home of William D. Taylor, according to officials of the Lasky company, prove that the murdered motion-picture director was at least a lieutenant in the British forces. Among the army records found, a pass of leave from duty in Dunkirk, dated April 4, 1919, shows that William D. Taylor was at that time a lieutenant in the British forces. An embarkation ticket bearing the name of William D. Taylor, according to the Lasky officials, shows that the director was a lieutenant, and also shows the army number F-56979, and regiment E.F.C., R.A.S.C. It is further stated that Mr. Taylor was discharged with the rank of captain.
1922-02-09	No more perfect stage setting for a dramatic tragedy could have been wished for by the most exacting director or stage manager than the artistic arrangement of the house in which William D. Taylor, director and art connoisseur, met his death. If the front wall of the house had been removed, a description of the first floor might well be taken for the preface of a one-act play. Imagining this front wall to be a drop curtain which has just been rolled up there will appear in the extreme foreground, a little right of center, a small mahogany writing desk, over which are scattered papers, checks and letters. At the left of center stands a magnificent grand piano [sic] with an oriental covering of soft mauves and mulberry shades. At right of center a large tapestry divan of neutral tone, figured in dull mauve tints. Behind the divan a large window curtained in deep cream filet lace with aide drapes of figured chintz harmonizing in color with the mulberry velvet carpet on the floor. Immediately behind this large living room, separated from it merely by simulated pillars, is a small dining room. The carpet is of the identical color, fabric and pattern as that which covers the living room floor; a William and Mary dining room table stands in the center and scattered through both rooms are reed and mahogany chairs, upholstered in mulberry velvet. The walls of these adjoining rooms are covered with dull gold and olive tapestry over which are hung scores of photographs, pictures of beautiful moving picture actresses and of men known internationally in the film world. Perhaps no single wall in the world held so complete a collection of famous screen beauties. Behind the dining room is a small kitchen, complete in every detail from its white enamel sink and drain boards to its spotless refrigerator and polished range. The front bedroom, furnished in old ivory, with a pale blue Axminster rug and white muslin curtains, was the one formerly occupied by the man who met his death at the hands of an assassin's bullet. Two large windows looked out on the wide, green court and side windows, allowing floods of light and air, gave the room an unusually well ventilated aspect. On the dresser lay numerous toilet articles, all silver mounted and handsome, showing the aesthetic taste of a fastidious man, but all plain and substantial without any effeminate touches. On the table lay a variety of books, fiction, history, technical volumes connected with the work of the dead man. A blue and white blanket and a white Marseilles spread covered the bed in which the dead man was wont to sleep. This had been his home for the last three years and standing there on the threshold of this room, the most private sanctum and retreat a human being maintains for himself, one wondered what dreams of romance, wealth or glory flitted through the brain of the man now sleeping beneath six feet of earth [sic] and a blanket of roses, or what haunting fears, arising from spectres of the past, tormented that crumpled pillow? Of all the beautiful women that he knew, which face was it that floated through his dreams, and was it to hope and anticipated pleasure or to despair that he awoke in the morning? In the bedroom at the rear stand twin beds, covered with plain white spreads. Between the two bedrooms is a white tiled bath room with a huge tub and shower and a large medicine cabinet filled with bottles of every description, household remedies and simple drugs, but showing that the former occupant suffered with a variety of ailments from eye trouble to falling hair. In this cabinet were two varieties of talcum powder, two perfume bottles with distinctly different odors, and other articles pertaining more to feminine tastes than masculine. An air of seclusion and security one might have felt in this house, which is set well back in the court from the street and surrounded by sedate looking dwellings that would seem to frown on and forbid the presence of crime. But from the successful manner in which the murderer has broken all threads of the clew which would implicate him in the deed, probably no more cold-blooded crime was ever planned. There at the little mahogany desk, in the immediate foreground, a trifle to the right of center, on Wednesday evening, February 1, about eight o'clock, sat William D. Taylor, probably the best known and best loved moving picture director in the West. A bright light burned over his desk and a long evening's work lay ahead of him. With the lights out in the kitchen and the dining room at the rear, a murderer might well have hidden in the dusky, purple shadows, and over the soft velvet carpet he could have glided in silence until he reached out and touched his victim. Who knows but what he may have muffled his revolver and shot at such close range that the speeding bullet made no perceptible report or echo, except in the startled consciousness of the man whose soul and body were rent apart in the twinkling of an eye. And all night long, as the body of the murdered man lay on the floor, the crimson life-blood silently oozing out drop by drop, dyeing the soft carpet a deeper hue, all night long the lights burned on his desk, throwing weird gleams and shadows on the pictures of the beautiful moving picture actresses on the wall; what ghosts stalked through this silent sepulcher that night? What echoes of the fleeing murderer resounded in the streets outside? But now, as though no breath of crime had ever stifled out a human life, the birds twitter in the eaves and over the doorway and the sun streams through the windows and flickers in dancing circles over the carpets, which show no visible reminders of the crime. Only a silence, a hush like that of wonder, seems to hold the unspoken whisper. Why? Who? Where is he now?
1922-02-09	Mabel Normand's missing letters to William Desmond Taylor, slain film director, have been found. A dainty handkerchief with the initials 'M.M.M.' in a corner--apparently a keepsake of Mr. Taylor--also has been recovered. The letters, about which an investigation has been conducted for several days, were written by the famous screen actress during her friendship with the noted director, who had directed such stars as Mary Miles Minter, Mary Pickford, Betty Compson and others. Miss Normand has attempted to recover these letters, which she stated were in the possession of Mr. Taylor before his murder a week ago Wednesday night shortly after Miss Normand left his home. The officers have made every effort to find them. Yesterday the police search was rewarded when a packet of letters, admittedly written by Miss Normand, was found in a boot in Mr. Taylor's closet. The find was made during a search of the place by Captain of Detectives Adams and his aides, Detective Sergeants Cahill, Herman Cline, Cato and Murphy. Charles Eyton, manager of the Famous Players-Lasky studio, to whom Mr. Taylor was under a two-year contract, said last night that he was at the house when the letters were found, but was not present in the upstairs room when the actual discovery was made. E. C. Jessurund [sic], proprietor of the apartment court in which Mr. Taylor lived, was present, Mr. Eyton said. The letters comprised a large packet and from statements made by Chief Dep. Dist. Atty. Doran yesterday it was understood the District Attorney's office came into possession of them. Miss Normand was an intimate friend of Mr. Taylor and during times when she was in New York and he was here she wrote to him, she said, in explaining her desire to get the letters. She stated she wished to have them because she feared that some of the terms used in them might be misconstrued, although she and Mr. Taylor understood there was no serious love affair. The handkerchief, which was kept among other personal effects of Mr. Taylor, was found by Henry Peavey, negro houseman, who found his employer's body last Thursday morning. 'Here's the handkerchief all you boys have been bothering about,' Peavey says he announced. It was taken from him by the detectives and placed with the other personal effects that may have a bearing on the solution of the crime. From statements Peavey had previously made about seeing the handkerchief many weeks before the murder, however, it is believed, it has no direct bearing on the problem of who killed Mr. Taylor.
1922-02-09	...An asserted love cult, an organization of mysterious ways and membership, yesterday was reported to attaches of the District Attorney's office, and is under investigation now. Mr. Taylor is declared to have been on intimate terms with the members, if, indeed, he was not one of the cult's followers. A touch of oriental mysticism was included in the report given to the investigators... ...Mr. Manning turned over to the police the report from Arizona concerning Sands. The message from Tucson, reads as follows: 'Walter Peterson, on way to Imperial, Cal., care of H. H. Peterson, Imperial, feels certain he met Edward F. Sands at Lowell, Ariz., February 4 and 5. Description same as Los Angeles newspapers of February 7, also wore dark suit with light pin stripe, plain yellow shirt; brown shoes; soft brown hat. Sands told him he was a deserter from the British navy, and was machine- gun man for Pancho Villa. Had been in New York, British Columbia, Alaska, Los Angeles and Hollywood. (Signed) 'B. F. Daniels 'Sheriff' ...A final search of the Taylor home, conducted yesterday by Detectives Cline, Cato and Cahill while Public Administrator Bryson was removing the possessions from the apartment disclosed a bank-book belonging to Sands. This book, showing he had made deposits in a Los Angeles bank, was found behind a book case. A business card, apparently dropped in the house, also was found. A check on the person whose name appeared thereon is being made although it was regarded as probable that the card had been there some time before Mr. Taylor was shot to death. Undersheriff Biscailuz late in the day admitted the Sheriff's office is working hard on three 'leads' tending to connect prominent film people with the slaying. The Sheriff's office holds little credence in the theory that Sands committed the crime. Information in the hands of the police detectives, however, indicate that Sands was near the scene of the crime about the time of the shooting, which is officially believed to have been about 7:50 or 7:55 p.m. a week ago yesterday. He also has been reported from reliable sources to have been in Los Angeles both before and after that day.
1922-02-09	...Mr. Doran is said to be interested in the report that Taylor's body had been carefully laid out. This statement comes from F. Parsons, a member of the police flying squadron, who, with Detective Zeigler, was the first to reach the scene of the crime. The director, says Parsons, was not sprawled on the floor, as one would have expected, considering the apparent physical facts of the slaying, but was lying with feet together and hands at sides as though some person had very carefully arranged his body. Would a man like Sands have taken this trouble? Would a man whose jealousy had turned into hate and hate flared forth in an act of murder have been concerned how the victim appeared in death? Rather, ask the police, does not the patient care with which this funereal task was performed suggest the slayer to have been a woman who loved him?... Captain Adams and men working under him on the case attach great importance to the bullet removed from the body of Taylor and to its peculiar value as evidence should the murderer ever be caught and brought to trial. Firearms experts have determined that it is of a kind manufactured many years ago and have found rifling marks and a nick on one of its edges. As a result of its classification the police now have a fairly accurate idea of the character of revolver used. It was learned yesterday that operatives of the United States Department of Justice have conducted an independent investigation and have developed certain angles not appearing in the evidence secured by the police or sheriff's officers. One of these, it is said, relates to a woman who has not been mentioned in any of the reports thus far published. Valuable information, it is said, was secured from this woman.
1922-02-09	Marion, O.--Disbelief that his son, Edward Fitzgerald Snyder, could be the man known as Edward Sands and sought in connection with the murder of William D. Taylor, motion-picture director at Los Angeles, Cal., was expressed by Murray T. Snyder, manager of a local telegraph office tonight. While he did not know his present location, Mr. Snyder said he presumed his son was alive, since he had received a telegram from him in Cleveland about three months ago. Mr. Snyder said he did not know whether the son had been in California in several months...
1922-02-09	...Bryson said that an investigation of Taylor's checks running back through several years had just been completed by a federal government employee connected with the income tax department and that there were no missing checks. The complete tally of checks with the stubs indicates that no effort was made by Taylor's murderer to suppress evidence of blackmailing activities, according to Public Administrator Bryson Bryson also said that the check probe showed that Taylor had not spent a dollar for insurance. Efforts to interview Mack Sennett, moving picture producer and employer of Mabel Normand, to ascertain his theory on whether Mabel Normand's visit had anything to do with precipitating the crime, failed Thursday. 'Mr. Sennett has been confined to his bed for the past two weeks with a severe cold,' his Japanese servant told a Record reporter late Thursday at the Sennett residence, 141 Menlo street. The Japanese servant took the reporter's card inside the house. A moment later another servant returned with profuse apologies, saying that Sennett had such a sore throat that he could not talk. He said his employer had been ill and confined to his bed for two weeks. Major Thomas A. Osborne, British consul, with offices in the Loew State Theater building, was momentarily expecting a telegram from Judge Frank G. Schrenkheisen, New Rochelle, New York, personal representative of Ethel Daisy Tanner, daughter of the murdered man, it was said Thursday. British consulates in the United States are working independently to solve the murder mystery, Attorney B. Rey Schauer, counsel for the local consulate, said. Five persons had been examined late Thursday by District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine, who took over the direction of the investigation just before noon... Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz announced Thursday that further questioning of Mrs. Douglas MacLean Wednesday night resulted in clearing her of the implication that she was holding something back in order to protect the motion picture industry from scandal. He said that Mrs. MacLean convinced him she was telling all she knew about seeing a man on the Taylor porch just after the murder. There are others in the movie colony who are not so frank, Biscailuz hinted... A literary lover, who, with books, suggested things a less adroit man would bluntly speak. This analysis of the character of Taylor forms a basis for the murder theory upon which one group of investigators are now working...The county detectives who are following this new trail hold that Taylor was not entirely indifferent to women. He was, however, what might be called choicy--a connoisseur. According to their theory, when the fancy of the eminent picture director became fixed on a certain woman he made her the present of a book. It was a book on some subject--not too intimate--that would easily give rise to comment and discussion between the donor and the recipient. This book was followed by another, more intimate in character, which suggested some subjects not hitherto discussed between them. This book suggested another, and so on. By this time he would have thoroughly established himself with the woman... W. C. Doran, chief aide to District Attorney Woolwine, who is now in command of the united forces of investigators, announced Thursday that private interests would be disregarded in the effort to capture Taylor's slayer. The film folk who might have any knowledge bearing upon the past of Taylor will be rigidly questioned, according to Doran's statement. Among the movie characters who are expected to go on the grill there are two outstanding figures, both men, both producers of world-wide reputation, both supposed to be admirers of a celebrated film actress who was a close friend of the murdered man. Both men will be asked to account for their whereabouts on the night of the murder. One is supposed to have been confined to his home by illness. The whereabouts of the other has not been suggested.
1922-02-09	It was a lonely little Mary Miles Minter who described William D. Taylor, the murdered motion picture director. With one satin-slippered foot doubled under her, and her white hands linked about her other knee as she sat on the huge divan in her home the little blonde star said: 'He was so dignified--so austere--so wonderful! 'Everyone loved dear Old Billy Taylor. 'He was always good to everyone. 'I was always happy when I was out with him--which, unfortunately, wasn't very often.' The blue eyes of lonely Mary Miles Minter grew moist. 'It wasn't me only that he was good to--he treated everyone that way. 'He didn't have an enemy in the world--I am sure of that. He could only be compared with God--he was so good! 'Before we went to Europe,' said the girlish moving picture star, 'I saw a great deal of Mr. Taylor. 'But--after that'--her voice trailed off in silence. Again she spoke: 'After that I couldn't get him to go anywhere much. He was so interested in his work. He would bury himself in his apartment for days--yes, weeks at a stretch, when he was working on a new picture. 'I don't believe he ever had a wife. He never told me he had. And our acquaintance was such that I am sure he wouldn't deceive me--no, he wouldn't. 'I cannot believe Mr. Taylor is dead. I pinch myself to wake up--I feel that I am dreaming. 'Oh, that I could wake up and know that I had a horrible nightmare--how happy I would be!'
1922-02-09	...Mabel Normand, slated as one of the chief witnesses today, already has made a statement for use by the district attorney's office. This statement, relative to her letters which mysteriously disappeared for seven days, corroborates her previous assertions regarding them. Her testimony in this regard reads in part: 'I went to Mr. Taylor's home on Wednesday evening (just previous to the slaying of the director) to get back the letters I had written to him. He said, 'I mailed them back to you yesterday.' I replied that they had not yet arrived and then he said, 'I think Eyton or Garbutt have them.' Then I told him that I did not care if the world saw them except that it might be embarrassing to both of us because they might be misunderstood.' Miss Normand also added that her physical condition was such at the time of her asserted conversation with Taylor that she could not remember much of his actual conversation with her. She was on the verge of a nervous breakdown at that time, she said... [The above material is considered to be totally incorrect and fabricated by the press.]
1922-02-09	...it was said that a prominent film man, acting in executive capacity at one of the larger studios, would be called to tell what he knows of the strange disappearance of the Normand letters. The missives, according to the star herself, were in Taylor's possession at the time of his death. They had dropped from sight when the murder was discovered. Then, just seven days later, they came to light hidden in one of Taylor's riding boots. It is possible, investigators conclude, that the packet was taken by the man mentioned, 'edited,' and some of the letters removed. The alleged 'merely friendly' ones were then returned according to this theory. Miss Normand had previously stated that there was nothing serious between Taylor and herself, but that some of the letters contained endearing terms... ...At the sheriff's office practically every investigator scoffs at the Sands theory. The attempted fixing of responsibility on the former secretary, is a 'frame-up,' it is charged, and the outgrowth of the 'conspiracy of silence' which, it is asserted, has been planned by certain important personages in the motion picture industry.
1922-02-09	...Rumors that the district attorney's office has undertaken an investigation of reports that thousands of dollars had been spent by motion picture interests to quiet the investigation of Taylor's death were vigorously denied today. Doran stated that police detectives and others have been in close touch with the district attorney's office and that no attempts to block the investigation had been encountered by him as yet. The fact that the district attorney's office has taken charge of the investigation is said to please motion picture officials vitally interested in the case. With Woolwine and Doran in charge the investigation will proceed systematically without unwarranted suspicion being directed against innocent parties. It was considered probable today that Woolwine will withdraw from the trial of Mrs. Madalynne Obenchain, charged with the murder of J. Belton Kennedy, to take direct and personal charge of the investigation of the Taylor case. Woolwine intended entering the trial of Mrs. Obenchain after the selection of the jury had been completed...
1922-02-09	POLICE SAY FACTS IN TAYLOR MURDER ARE NOT REVEALED . Allege Movie People Are Suppressing information to Save industry. POINT TO MISSING LETTERS Theory is Now Advanced That Woman May have Shot Film Director While Embracing him. ANOTHER MAN QUESTIONED Slain Director's Property is Taken over to Arrange for a Settlement of the Estate. Special to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES,Cal., Feb. 8. Police and county detectives investigating the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery have arrived simultaneously at the conclusion that some facts are being suppressed. Some of Taylor's associates are believed to know more about the murder than they are telling. The reason for this secrecy is believed to be the desire to protect the movie industry from scandal. A new theory of the murder was advanced today and received some consideration at the Sheriff' s office. It is that Taylor was shot by a woman whom he was embracing and who had her arms around him. The theory is based on the position of the bullet found in his back and the fact that Taylor is thought to have his arms raised when he was  killed. Rage, because she had been scorned by the Director, is the motive  imputed to the woman. The mysterious disappearance of telegrams and letters from Mabel Normand, which she says were kept in a bureau drawer by Taylor, has not yet been cleared up. Among the telegrams from Miss Normand to Taylor were believed to have been a number sent by the comedienne in Los Angeles in 1919, when Taylor was "on location" in Massachusetts with one of the Famous  Players producing units. Addressed to "Captain" Taylor. These telegrams were said to have  been addressed to "Captain" Taylor. Taylor was known by a military title for some time after his discharge from the British Army. The exchange of wires was said to have been an attempt to patch up a disagreement between them arising over the attentions one was bestowing on a third member of the picture colony. Miss Normand was starring in "The Slim Princess," George Ade's picture, in 1919. it was made at the Goldwyn studios. Victor Schertzinger was Miss Normand's director. Taylor at the time was directing Mary Miles Minter in "Ann of Green Gables," made in Massachusetts. A new figure was drawn, within the scope of investigation of the case, when operatives of the District Attorney's office, it is learned, made efforts today to question one of the biggest independent figures in the motion picture business. This man, recently divorced, was said to have been madly in love with an actress who apparently held Taylor in higher esteem. He is reported to have proposed marriage on numerous occasions to the actress whose silken nightgown police detectives assert they found in Taylor's home shortly after he was shot. "Some one is going to be arrestedand suddenly-for the Taylor murder," UnderSheriff Eugene Biscail said today. "And it will not be Edward F. Sands, Taylor's missing valet. Taylor was killed through jealousy and not revenge," A fight to save the professional reputation of Mary Miles Minter was started today by her friends. Hollywood's financiers, dealt a severe blow in the Arbuckle case, are resolved that no more screen prestige in which thousands  of dollars have been invested shall be lost. Several financiers met her attorneys today at her home, Behind drawn curtains, while private detectives stood guard to keep outsiders away, the conference continued during the night. Mabel Normand, who fainted at Taylor's funeral yesterday, expected to be the director's wife, according to Henry Peavey, negro valet of the murdered director. She told me," said Peavey to police detectives, " that she and Mr. Tayior were going to be married." Miss Normand Denies Engagement. Miss Normand. who was in a state bordering on collapse at her home today denied again that she and Taylor were ever engaged. The District Attorney's office has received a letter from a woman describing a meeting between two mysterious men driving two automobiles at a street corner the night of the killing. One was heard to say to the other: " Now that we've got him we're in for  it." Both were so muffled up that their features were indistinguishable. They parted going in different directions. One of them dropped a strip of film showing the Grand Canyon with the caption "A deep and brooding mystery seems to hover over this great scar on the face of nature." Detectives are going over film found in Taylor's home to see whether this was taken from his collection. A complaint charging Sands with the murder was to be issued today by the District Attorney's office. William Doran, Chief Deputy District Attorney said there was no doubt in his mind that Sands is the guilty man. The former secretary has been a fugitive from justice for several months, charged with grand larceny and forgery. Another love letter to Taylor has been found in the effects of the murdered man. It is written in a simple schoolgirl cipher. and the translation is reproduced, except for the last paragraph: "What shall I call you, you wonderful man? You are standing on the lot, the idol of an adoring company. You have just come over and put your coat on my chair. I want to go away with you, up in the hills or anywhere, just so we'd be alone-all alone. In a beautiful little woodland lodge you'd be cook (as I can only make tea), and fetch the water and build the fire. Move to Settle Estate, Public Administrator Bryson, together with several deputies, went to the slain man's house today to remove his personal effects that the estate might be settled. Clothing, books, a phonograph and piano and various papers were taken into custody. Mr. Bryson stated that there were not papers of material interest in those that he took. He stated that the police and the District Attorney had been through them prior to his office taking charge and that any papers of value were removed by them. The estate, it was stated, would not total more than $20,000 unless unknown safety deposit boxes or bank accounts in his name are found. It is believed that there is a sum in a New York bank but investigations thus far have failed to reveal it. In Mr: Taylor's effects are several hundred canceled ohecks. Many of them are for ioans and are endorsed with the names prominent in the motion picture world. Bills, both paid and unpaid, were found. No word has been recelved concerning the disposition of the yaluables, and they will be kept in storage until the entire estate can be checked up. As no other heirs are in evidence, Mr. Bryson stated that Mr. Taylor's daughter will  be the recipient.  
1922-02-09	Navy Forwards Fall Data On Man Resembling Sands   The complete description, finger prints and specimens of the handwriting of a naval deserter believed by naval officials to resemble closely Edward F. Sands, missing butlersecretary, wanted by Los Angeles police in connection with the killing of William Desmond Taylor, motion-picture cirector, were sent to the police of the California city yesterday by Rear Admiral Thomas Washington, chief of the bureau of navigation of the Navy Department. The bureau of navigation, in transmitting its information to the Los Angeles police, made this explanation: "While the bureau cannot say with certainty that this is the man you desire apprehended, it was thought so long as the description of Strathmore was so close to that of Sands it would be advisable for you to have this information for use in making your investigation." The naval career of the deserter considered as possibly being Sands was a hectic one, according to Navy Department records, including a dishonorable discharge for embezzlement, two fraudulent reenlistments and two desertions, all within a period of eight years. Names used by the deserter included Edward Fitzgerald Snyder of Marion, Ohio, and Edward Fitz William Strathmore, of Boston, Mass. 
1922-02-09	DEATH CLEWS HIDDEN   ylor's Body "Arranged" Before Police Came, Is Charge.   SEARCH FOR SANDS PRESSED   Officials say "Influences" Hinder progress in Murder Inquiry.  Chauffeur Reports Having Heard Miss Normand and Slain Direcor Quarrel-Actress Denies Letters Have Been Returned to Her. Miss Minter Remains Secluded. County to Start New Quiz Today.   (By the Associated Press.) Los Angeles, Calif., Feb. 8.-A statement that the body of William Desmond Taylor, slain motion picture director, had been placed in order before the police arrived to investigate the tragedy was made by F. Parsons, a member of the "flying quadron" of police which answers rry calls, the police allowed it to be known today. The report Parsons gave his superiors said the body had been carefully "laid out" on the floor of Taylor's apartments, and a chair overturned across his legs. His report said by attaches of the district Atorney's office, to have "interested" them very much. Parsons, with Detective Thomas Zeigler, reached the scene before any other officers. Further investigation of the killing to be centralized in the district Attorneys office, it was announced. It was believed this centralization would result in the breaking down of "the conspiracy of silence" the police declared existed on the part of the motion picture people concerning details essential to the apprehension of the assailant.   Still Looking for Sands. The blank wall, which, they said, unidentified infiuences appear to have grown up between them and the ue facts remains unpierced. although the police department and the office of the sheriff were attempting  to make separate breaches through it into new fields of inquiry. Announcement was made that there would be a investigation of reports that attemps had been made to suppress information concerning the case. The police continued to concentrate their efforts upon search for Edward F. Sands, former secretary and butler for Taylor, missing since Taylor made a charge of grand larceny against him last August. Capt. David L. Adams, head of the detective bureau, reiterated that "there is no one else to we want and have discovered nothing that would indicate a motive for the crime except that of averting prosecution on the grand larceny charge."   Suspect in Arizona. Late today the detective bureau received through the sheriff's office a message from the sheriff at Tucson, Ariz., to the effect that a man resembling Sands was seen at Lowell, Ariz., February 4, three days after Taylor was slain. The sheriff's office here, according to the deputies working on the case, up to tonight, had wound up at a "blank wall" in every step it had taken. This investigation, it was said, had nothing to do with Sands. Included in these obstacles were the disappearance of bits of evidence, including letters written to Mr. Taylor by Mary Miles Minter and Mabel Normand, and which were believed to have been in his home when he was shot. These letters were gone immediately after the shooting, and reports yesterday said they had been returned to the writers by some unofficial agency. Miss Normand denied that she had received her letters. Miss Minter was in seclusion, her residence guarded by detectives, but a denial was issued for her also.   Initial Handkerchief doneAnother disappearing clew was a handkerchief initialed "S," but which the police did not believe was the property of Edward F. Sands, former houseman, now sought in connection with the case. The police said they believed this handkerchief belonged to a motion picture producer, and they wanted it so they would have something tangible with which to I confront him as a basis for interrogation. Former efforts to end the wide pubCONTINUED ON NINTH PAGSE.   DEATH CLEWS HIDDEN CONTINUED FROM FIRST PAGE. Publicity given the case and those connected with it were also intensified, representatives of Miss Minter especially seeking to prevent publication of the fact that her home was under  guard. The disappearance from Taylor's home of a woman's pink silk night dress, which was said by Henry Peavey, houseman, to have been kept there, was another item in the list of occurrences deterrent to the investigation and vigorous efforts was being made to find out what became of it.   Peavy to be Quizzed. The sheriff's investigators said they expected to examine Henry Peavey, house man for Taylor, in an effort to obtain corroboration or denial of certain statements made to them by other parties, and that possibly some light would be thrown on the situation by this. Peavy passed the day assisting officers in checking over Taylor's effects at the apartment where the slaying occurred. These articles were taken, after the checking, to a storage warehouse under the direction of the public administrator. The police took charge of certain articles, as possibly having some bearing on the killing, but did not state what they were. After the search, Capt. Adams said there had been no letters discovered and that he never had seen any letters adressed to Taylor with the exception of a half dozen from the director's former wife and daughter. These, he declared, had absolutely no bearing upon the case. Mabel Normand and Mary Miles  Minter. motion picture actresses. friends of the slain director. who have been questioned about the case, remained in seclusion today. Both police and sheriff's investigators said late in the afternoon no further information had been sought from them.   Navy Department Sends Dates. While Associated Press dispatches from Washington announced the Navy Department had forwarded to the police descriptions of a deserter from the navy who had used the name Strathmore, which was known to have been used by Sands, the police said they had no direct information from the department. They professed anxiety to get the official description, saying they could makes good use of it. The Los Angeles Examiner today published an unsigned letter found among Taylor's effects, in which the writer painted a vivid word picture of an imaginary life with Taylor in "a beautiful woodland lodge, where they would be alone." The letter told how the writer would cook, sweep and dust while Taylor "fetched the water and built the fire." How she would feed the birds and wait patiently darning socks for him to come home at night and how in the evenings they would sit cozily by the fire listening to the wind whistling outside." It frequently referred to Taylor as "you wonderful man." Part of the letter was withheld by the Examiner.   Quarrel With Miss Normand. A quarrel between Taylor and Mabel Normand was described by Harry Fellows, chauffeur for Taylor, according to the Los Angeles Examiner today. "I was driving Mr. Taylor and Miss Normand from the Ambassador hotel, where they had attended a New Year's eve party, to her home." Fellows is reported to have said. "On the way they had a quarrel. I don't know what it was about, but both were very much excited. Mr. Taylor took Miss Normand home and then returned to his apartment. Upon arriving there he broke down and wept. On the following morning he did up some jewelry in a package and took it to Miss Normand at her home." Harry Peavey, negro houseman for Taylor, who found the slain director's body, confirmed Fellow's statements.   Murderer Acted Quickly. Fellows said that Taylor and Miss Normand were "very affectionate." Fellows left Taylor's house at 4:30 o'clock Wednesday afternoon, on the night of which Taylor was slain. He was instructed to be sure the telephone at 7:30 o'clock, he said. He said that he telephoned from a girl's house at 7:55 o'clock, and there being   no answer from Taylor 's home, he went there. He reached the Taylor place at 8:15 o'clock, and rang the bell and knocked at the door. There was no response, so he put up the car and went home. "I am satisfied that I am the man  Mrs. Douglas MacLean saw standing on the porch and leaving the house," Fellows said. "I wore a cap and overcoat." Miss Normand had informed the police that she left Taylor between 7:30 and 7:45 o'clock and, with Fellows telephoning at 7:55 o'clock. It is indicated that the murder was committed between 7:30 and 7:55 o'clock. The Los Angeles county district attorney 's office will begin investigation of the tragedy on its own account tomorrow, it was stated by an official of that office late today. Up to this time activities of the office had been confined to assistance it has given the city police department. In the new investigation evry angle of the case will be taken up, and motion-picture people and others heretofore questioned will be sought for additional information, it was said.
1922-02-09	Goldwyn Denies Producers Suppressing Tragedy Facts New York, Feb. 9 Reports that motion picture producers were attempting to suppress the true facts in the recent slaying in Los Angeles of William Desmond Taylor, director, "are too absurd to warrant comment," Samuel Goldwyn. of the Goldwyn Pictures Corporation, said today. The public should realize, he added, that the picture industry, like any other, is made up "of all sorts of people and that being a moving picture man or woman is no more indication of character than being a plumber, steel man, a merchant or what not."
1922-02-10	The belief of detectives that if Edward F. Sands, valet-secretary to William D. Taylor, killed his employer, he was insane, was bolstered last night by information tending to show that the missing fugitive was mentally deranged. 'I don't know what I'd do if I lost my job and didn't have any money,' Sands is reported to have said. 'When I get to be 35 years old I'm going to blow my head off. I don't see any use of people living after that age. They're not good for anything.' Sands always carried a .45-caliber Colt revolver, Mr. Brettner said. One morning Mr. Brettner went to Sands's room and found him asleep. He touched him on the shoulder to awaken him. Sands turned over like a flash and pressed the weapon against Mr. Brettner, but when he saw who it was he turned over and went to sleep again without saying a word.
1922-02-10	A man believed to be an important witness, if not an actual conspirator in the murder of William Desmond Taylor, is in secret custody of the police at Topeka, Kansas. He admits that he was an intimate acquaintance of Edward F. Sands, fugitive valet-secretary to the slain motion picture director, and attended many orgies of women, liquor and 'dope' in the Taylor bungalow. Further admissions indicate that he was with Sands the night of the mysterious murder and that two days after it he embezzled more than $1000 from the Pacific Electric Railroad in Los Angeles to effect the escape of the pair. The suspect was taken off a Santa Fe train at Topeka, which left Los Angeles Monday evening. He took his arrest calmly. 'Well, you've got me,' he remarked to Sheriff Robert Miler, who boarded the train and grabbed him, 'and you've got a big one.' Then he admitted his name was Walter Underwood and that he was employed by the Los Angeles interurban line until his departure. 'What made you depart?' he was asked. 'Well, I embezzled more than $1000 and had to go,' he said. 'But my father is worth $300,000 and he will get me out of this scrape.' 'What do you know about the Taylor murder?' asked Sheriff Miler. 'I knew Sands and Taylor well,' he said. 'I have been on many parties at the Taylor bungalow, where Mabel Normand and other actresses were present. (Miss Normand, seen at her home here last night, denied ever knowing Underwood or ever having heard his name.) 'In fact, I was on a wild party with Sands a night or two--well, it was so wild and long drawn out I don't recall exactly when it ended.' 'Would the party have been in progress the night of the murder?' 'Well--say, are you trying to hook me for that murder?' he suddenly exclaimed, and refused to talk any more. The man admitted that he was acquainted with both William Desmond Taylor and Sands, and saw Taylor a week before his death.
1922-02-10	The theory that Walter Underwood knew Edward F. Sands or had any knowledge of the crime was flouted by W. T. Maddex, Underwood's step-father. 'The boy was a lover of notoriety,' he said. 'I am certain that he never knew Sands or Taylor either. He would sometimes tell his mother in an off-hand way that he had met some of her friends or acquaintances on the street and it would later develop there was no truth in his story.' According to Maddex, Underwood was a lover of adventure. Maddex admitted that authorities had made the right arrest in connection with the embezzlement charge. 'We have both told Walter above all things else to be honest,' Maddex said seriously. 'I have many times heard his mother tell him that.' Maddex, although he has the utmost confidence and friendship of Pacific Electric officials, by virtue of the fact that he was formerly manager of the Redondo line, said he would make no move to soften his step-son's punishment. 'I had concluded that since Walter is 31 years old he is old enough to understand fully what he did. If he was let off this time, it might mean only a repetition of the offense.'
1922-02-10	While Mabel Normand, in a darkened room slept the sleep of exhaustion A. McArthur, publicity director for the Sennett studios and the Cerebus at present standing between the star and the press, today dictated this statement: 'Miss Normand and Taylor never were in love with each other. Why in the name of sense do the newspapers keep on harping on that silly stuff? 'Miss Normand was never engaged to Mack Sennett and he never was jealous of Taylor.' 'Mrs. John Borden of Chicago, claiming to be a close friend of Miss Normand, claims that Miss Normand was engaged to Sennett,' I suggested. 'Then she was talking nonsense,' was the emphatic retort. 'I didn't mean to say anything further for publication, but I'll say that. All we are trying to do is to keep the poor little girl's name out of the papers. Every time it occurs in connection with the murder it injures her.' 'What about the statement of Underwood, arrested in Topeka? He says a woman killed Taylor. Has Miss Normand any theories on that subject?' McArthur turned about and made a gesture of utter disgust. 'The poor nut,' he blurted. 'Underwood is crazy, bughouse. His statement is bunk, just bunk. 'Honest, we are not going to give out any more statements for Miss Normand. We are not going to deny or affirm. We are tired, burned out. 'Walter Underwood is just a poor boob. Why should we care what he says?' 'Are you certain Miss Normand is asleep?' I inquired. 'She should be,' replied Mr. McArthur, peeping between some heavy velvet curtains that separated the living-room from a rear chamber. 'Yes, she's asleep and I wish the gossip was as quiet. That's all. 'For God's sake, keep the girl's name out of this mess.'
1922-02-10	Sands Insane, Friend Thinks The belief of detectives that if Edward F. Sands, valet-secretary to William D. Taylor, killed his employer, he was insane, was bolstered last night by information tending to show that the missing fugitive was mentally deranged. George S. Brettner, who became well acquainted with Sands before the latter's disappearance more than a year ago, [sic] told of actions and remarks of a peculiar nature. At that time Sands was talking of joining a foreign navy or going to South America, according to Mr. Brettner. He said he was becoming restless and wanted a change, but spoke no ill of Mr. Taylor. 'I don't know what I'd do if I lost my job and didn't have any money,' Sands is reported to have said. 'When I get to be 35 years old I'm going to blow my head off. I don't see any use of people living after that age. They're not good for anything. I used to be chief petty officer in the Quartermaster Corps aboard ships, and I guess I might as well enlist and be taken care of until I'm ready to shoot myself.' Sands always carried a .45-caliber Colt revolver, Mr. Brettner said. One morning Mr. Brettner went to Sands's room and found him asleep. He touched him on the shoulder to awaken him. Sands turned over like a flash and pressed the weapon against Mr. Brettner, but when he saw who it was he turned over and went to sleep again without saying a word. 'Sands was keeping company with a girl who frequented Wilson's Dancing Academy,' said the informant. 'He seemed to be infatuated with her. He weighed about 185 pounds at that time and was trying to reduce to 150 pounds. I used to find him at Mr. Taylor's home perusing the Encyclopedia Brittanica by the hour. Sometimes he would refuse to speak to me, and when I'd meet him a few days later he would apologize and say he had been feeling depressed.' ...Mr. Brettner said he did not believe Sands killed the director unless perhaps he was seized with an insane obsession.
1922-02-10	Another scavenger's holiday. William Desmond Taylor was in life a man respected by his associates. He was an artist of high ideals. He was hard working, earnest, capable. He was a gentleman. But he was a motion picture director. So out come the scavengers to burrow in the garbage can, seeking morsels, titbits, little delicacies of ripe dirt to roll their tongues around. Out they come, headlong, before the corpse is cold. They wallow in a mud of their own making. They drag a man's name through that mud. With the vicious glee of the virtuous they make great sticking plasters of the mud and hurl them broadside at the motion picture colony. Instead of concentrating all their efforts toward finding the assassin and trying him for murder, they drag the dead man forth and put him on trial. He has committed the crime of being shot down without warning from behind. Away goes his name through the mud, swishing, swashing. Why? Because he was a motion picture director. It is always open season for anyone connected with the motion picture business. Having put him on trial instead of his assassin, what have they found? The one outstanding fact that he had taken stage name, a very common thing, indeed, in the profession of entertainment. They make this the basis for a claim that he had led a dual life. Puerile, imbecilic, certainly. But the scavengers must have their holiday. The found some letters. These proved nothing. They were not even very entertaining. So the scavengers, for want of better sport, have turned their mud guns on the picture colony and there is a great splattering. Is this fair? There are estimated to be about 30,000 persons engaged in the picture industry in Hollywood and its environs. Ninety-nine per cent of these, I venture to say, lead lives as clean and as decent as the best of people in other professions and other industries; they are 'just folks.' The other one per cent are more noisy, I think, than vicious, they can't be very wicked. They are too open about it. They flaunt their peccadilloes with a too-apparent wish to have them noticed. They wear noisy clothes, ride in noisy cars, live noisy lives. By the very nature of their employment, everything they do receives publicity. They are definitely in the public eye, under a microscope. Press agents record their smallest fads and fancies. Every move they make comes out magnified, exaggerated. And, of course, the bad comes out with the good, magnified, exaggerated. A home brew party in a four-room bungalow becomes 'a Neroesque orgy in a mansion.' The tongues of the righteous wag. But the noisy ones are no worse than their own prototypes elsewhere in every community. It is simply that more attention is attracted to them. It is the price of publicity. Hollywood, I should say, is about the average American community. A campaign of calumny against Berkeley, against San Jose, against any city of the size you can name, would have just as much reason for being as the present campaign against Hollywood. And there are just as many honest, decent men and women in the picture business as in any other business, even if they do not go around with pious looks mouthing the scavenger's chant, 'I am holier than thou.' People in glass houses shouldn't make home brew.
1922-02-10	Los Angeles--...Dumas said that on the night of the murder he had noticed that Taylor's study window shade was up several inches so anyone could have looked into the room and have seen him lying dead on the floor.
1922-02-10	...Twenty-five hundred dollars drawn from the First National Bank by William D. Taylor on January 31. Twenty-five hundred dollars redeposited by Taylor on February 1, the day of his murder. This record, first disclosed yesterday, was the sensational development of a day's investigation in which District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine, in command, examined eleven witnesses and laid the basis for a probe that shall be so far reaching and complete as to leave no element, angle or motive without the compass of evidence. The astonishing revelation regarding the money transaction was made yesterday by Public Administrator Frank Bryson. In looking over Taylor's canceled checks and check-book stubs, Bryson came upon the check made out to 'cash.' The $2500 was withdrawn on the last of the month. Inquiry at the bank brought to light the deposit slip for the same amount and the same entry in Taylor's bank book... The countrywide search for Sands has brought some interesting, and also confusing, reports regarding him. Police Detective J. B. Worley of Long Beach yesterday found, upon going through the records, that Sands was employed as a municipal life guard in that city on August 6, last, but failed to appear for work the next day and left behind him a pay voucher for $2.50, which is still due him. Statements from the Navy Department that descriptions of Edward F. Snyder, naval deserter, very accurately fit Sands, are doubted by Murray T. Snyder, telegraph operator at Marion, O., who stated yesterday, according to dispatches, that the man sought in connection with the Taylor murder could not be his son... One of the District Attorney's first announcements during the day was that 'the letters written by Mabel Normand to Mr. Taylor and now in our possession, contain nothing bearing upon the crime or tending to offer any solution of the mystery.' It is only to question witnesses at the request of the police and not to assume command of the investigation that he has undertaken the present work, Mr. Woolwine explained yesterday in a statement reading: 'It should be distinctly understood that the District Attorney's office has, in no sense, 'taken over' the investigation of the Taylor murder, as such work is peculiarly within the province of the police authorities. The fact is that officers working on this case came to the District Attorney's office, as is their custom in many cases, and requested that this office counsel and advise with them during the progress of their investigation, and that we take statements of various persons which may tend to throw some light upon what has so far proven to be a most baffling mystery. Although the officers have worked diligently, there has not so far been developed or submitted to the District Attorney one scintilla of evidence tending to connect any one with the murder.'...
1922-02-10	The police believe they have found the origin of the revolver with which William Desmond Taylor, film director, was slain, it was learned on reliable authority last night. Information has been placed in their possession that they think shows where the weapon was purchased, together with a description of the purchaser. Capt. of Detectives Adams was in conference on this point with one of his men late last night. If the data obtained are correct, the police believe they are on the verge of solving the mystery. Mary Miles Minter, film star whose admiration of William Desmond Taylor, slain film director, has been admitted by her, was one of the first witnesses who appeared at Dist.-Atty. Woolwine's office for the purpose of giving a full statement of her knowledge of any facts that may aid in solving the Taylor murder mystery, that has baffled investigators for more than a week. The fact that she was closeted for two hours with the officials at the District Attorney's office was learned last night. During yesterday's session, which lasted from 10 a.m. until after midnight in Mr. Woolwine's office, thirteen other witnesses were examined. Miss Minter's appearance at the District Attorney's office and her questioning there have not been made know or admitted by the officials, although the visit occurred last Tuesday. Ostensibly Mr. Woolwine assumed charge of taking statements in cooperation with the police officers only yesterday. That he questioned Miss Minter before the other witnesses is regarded as significant in some respects, since it is known that Miss Minter was an intimate friend of Mr. Taylor, and is reported by employees of Mr. Taylor to have held first place in his regard for many months. Another film star of first magnitude has made a statement for the purposes of aiding the investigation, it was stated upon excellent authority late in the day. She is declared to be Mabel Normand, actress who was perhaps the last friend to see Mr. Taylor alive a week ago Wednesday night, when she left his apartments about 7:45 p.m. Both Miss Normand and Miss Minter have suffered nervous collapses since the discovery of their friend's dead body with a bullet through his back. John G. Mott, attorney for Miss Minter, declined last night to comment on the fact that Miss Minter was at the District Attorney's office last Tuesday for two hours. He said: 'I can only say that Mary Miles Minter is cooperating with the officials and is willing and ready to cooperate fully with them.' At the home of both Miss Minter and Miss Normand, it was emphatically denied that either had made a statement attributed to Miss Normand yesterday concerning an asserted discussion between her and Mr. Taylor over her letters the night he was slain. The purported statement was that Miss Normand asked for her letters, and was told they had been sent to one or two high officials in the Famous-Players Lasky studio... The first witness last night before the following officials--Mr. Woolwine, Chief Dep. Dist.-Atty. Doran, and Detective Sergeants Cato, Cahill and Winn--was Capt. Robertson, formerly of the United States Infantry, and an intimate friend of the dead man. Capt. Robertson knew Mr. Taylor for three years. He was one of the first persons to enter the home the morning the murder was discovered. His statement concerning the physical facts at the scene of the crime was regarded as important. His knowledge of Mr. Taylor's life in recent years also was valuable in aiding the investigation. Others questioned last night included Mr. and Mrs. Charles Maigne, the former being a motion picture director, and one of the first in the Taylor home after the murder; Arthur Hoyt, actor and friend of Mr. Taylor, and others, whose names have figured in the inquiry; Verne Dumas, a neighbor of Mr. Taylor, and Neil Harrington, also a neighbor. Mr. Dumas, director in the Cal-Mex Oil Company, was among those who responded to the alarm after the murder. He also saw the blind in the front room of the Taylor apartment raised about four inches when he came home on the night of the slaying about 11 o'clock. The light was on at that time, but the fact that the curtain was raised was unusual, he said. Mr. Harrington, also a broker, was the first person to enter the house upon the discovery of the body. Every detail of the arrangement of the furniture, the exact location and angle of the body and other physical facts were sought from him by the investigators. Arthur Hoyt and Mr. and Mrs. Maigne stated upon leaving the District Attorney's office near midnight that they had promised not to divulge the nature of their information Reports published in a local newspaper that a woman was in the Taylor home an hour before Miss Normand left there the night of the murder were denied by Mr. Woolwine, who stated no such information has been obtained. A new witness who is believed to have seen the slayer lurking near the scene of the crime within a hour after the shooting on the 1st inst., was questioned in the afternoon. This new witness, Patrolman Long, was the last from whom a statement was taken in the afternoon. He was the seventh person called to the District Attorney's office, which is working in cooperation with the police detectives. Others from whom statements were taken in shorthand include Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean, both widely known in filmdom; their maid, Christine Jewett; Harry Fellows, former chauffeur and more recently an assistant director for Mr. Taylor; Howard Fellows, chauffeur for the slain man; and Henry Peavey, colored butler-valet, who discovered his employer's body on the morning following the crime... One of the outstanding developments of the day was the assurance given by Mrs. MacLean, it is declared, that she could recognize the man she saw leaving Mr. Taylor's home at 404-B South Alvarado street soon after the fatal shot was heard. Another important point was set at rest when she was asked to look at Howard Fellows, the chauffeur, to see whether he could have been the man she saw. It is understood she positively stated he was not the man. This factor was injected into the case by a peculiar circumstance. Mr. Fellows, who says he had been instructed by Mr. Taylor to call for him, went to the Taylor home and rang the doorbell about 8 o'clock, or a few moments afterward. It was believed he might have been the man seen by Mrs. MacLean, for he had said that after getting no response he walked away. Mrs. MacLean, her husband and her maid were accompanied to the District Attorney's office yesterday morning and taken into a room adjoining that in which Mr. Fellows was waiting. She was asked whether he was the man and her answer in the negative is understood to have been positive... The recently 'refound' letters of Mabel Normand--letters which she wrote to Mr. Taylor and which could not be found in his possession for many days after his murder--still were the center of much discussion and speculation yesterday. Mr. Woolwine's office has them now. They have been examined. They contain nothing regarded as particularly essential to the solution of the crime. The District Attorney's office feels the letters were in the clothes closet, under lock and key, hidden in a boot, during all the search of the premises. These assurances came from the officials on the case. ...Mr. Woolwine ordered transcripts of the testimony as soon as the shorthand notes could be transcribed. This significant order was taken to mean that the statements of the witnesses will be checked carefully, and immediately, one against the other...
1922-02-10	New York, Feb. 9.--Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, mother of Mary Miles Minter, defends her daughter from insinuations given publication by the Taylor murder case in a telegram received today by Arthur James, editor of the Motion Picture World. The message reads: 'Mary adored Taylor as a child would her father and is badly broken up over tragedy. Friendship between the two was beautiful and she feels that she has lost one of her dearest friends. Mary has made complete statement to authorities and they scout at newspaper insinuations that Taylor may have been slain because of jealousy over Mary. She is refusing to talk for publication but is aiding authorities in every way to solve mystery. Letters in press only those of adoring young girl to man almost three times her age.

1922-02-10	Investigators of the Sheriff's force believe that yesterday they completely eliminated Edward F. Sands as a suspect in the murder of director William Desmond Taylor, following a new conference with Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean. Undersheriff Biscailuz and Chief of Criminal Investigation Manning visited Mrs. MacLean, wife of the motion-picture actor, at her residence at the direction of Sheriff Traeger. Mrs. MacLean was questioned prior to being summoned to the District Attorney's office. She is the only witness who saw the unidentified man leaving the Taylor residence a few minutes after she heard the shot fired on the night the director was slain. Mrs. MacLean stated positively, according to the Sheriff's office, that the man seen by her was not Sands. She knew Sands' appearance well, she said, and was unable to recognize the stranger who leisurely walked out of Mr. Taylor's apartments. 'We have been assured of Mr. and Mrs. MacLean's fullest cooperation in the investigation,' said Undersheriff Biscailuz. 'They told us all they know in complete detail. The man seen by her was neither Sands, nor Harry [sic] Fellows, the chauffeur, who rang the bell at Taylor's apartment shortly after 8 o'clock. She is confident she can identify the man who left the place if we can find him and we feel that her assistance in this direction may be of great value.'...
1922-02-10	...A telegram received by Administrator Bryson yesterday from Frank G. Schrenkeisen, New York attorney representing Elsie [sic] Daisy Tanner, the only known heir of Taylor, was the first intimation received her concerning any will. The telegram was to the effect that Taylor's daughter is in possession of a letter informing her that he had made out a will and that the same was in a Los Angeles safety deposit box. Inasmuch as no will was discovered in the only box that Taylor is known to have possessed, three theories have been advanced by the Public Administrator. The first, and most probable, is that Taylor is the owner of another box, the location of which was known only to himself, a box that contains documents of a highly confidential nature pertaining to the many baffling incidents of his life that have so far blocked all efforts of the police. The second theory is that Taylor destroyed his will. This explanation is scouted by close friends of the late director, as he is known to have been very methodical in regard to business affairs, and the fact no will was found in his effects has been a matter of much conjecture. The last explanation, and one which is given some credence, is that Taylor left bequests to a certain member of the film colony with whom he is known to have been on intimate terms, and that shortly following the discovery of the murder this paper was removed. That the star who might have been the beneficiary of this bequest might have been damaged rather than benefited in view of all the surrounding circumstances, is the ground advanced for this belief.
1922-02-10	...The first of the scandals rose to the breeze last spring when a young woman scenario writer committed suicide.

1922-02-10	Tracing the course of the $2500 check, said to have been drawn by William D. Taylor, slain motion picture director, on January 31, and redeposited on the day of his death, investigators today discovered that the film official had placed an order with a local concern for upwards of $3000 worth of diamonds. The diamonds were never delivered, it is said, and this may account for the fact that the money was replaced in the bank. Taylor, the police say, may have considered using the diamonds as a gift and later to have withdrawn this decision. While no details of the new angle to the case were made known, it is said a prominent motion picture actress, mentioned in connection with the case, also visited the jewelry shop in question on the same day... The district attorney said that nowhere in his investigation had he met with any reticence of movie stars or others to furnish information... ...The selection of David Hartford as successor to Taylor, a former director in the Motion Picture Directors' Association, was announced today by that organization...
1922-02-10	Two pairs of shoes, one formerly the property of Taylor, and the other of Edward F. Sands, were locked in a cabinet in Taylor's apartment, 404-B South Alvarado street, Friday. Sands' shoes were found by E. C. Jessurun, Taylor's landlord, in a back closet on the second floor of the Taylor bungalow. They are a light tan in color, short and broad in shape and are so stretched to accommodate Sands' particularly shaped feet to afford a good means of identification in Jessurun's opinion. Jessurun said he had informed the police about the shoes, but they had not expressed any interest in them. A detailed search made by Jessurun in the Taylor garage late Friday disclosed a pair of women's rubber bathing slippers, small in size. Also an empty leather small arms holster was found in the garage. In an old torn pair of trousers was found a white handkerchief with the initial R in one corner. Efforts were made by investigators Friday to find Ed Fowler, chauffeur for Taylor, following the discharge of Sands. Fowler is said to have known Sands and it is believed that he may have information to his whereabouts within the past few months. Fowler, who was discharged by Taylor, is not under suspicion himself. More than a score of automobile supply slips, receipted by Fowler, were found on the wall of the Taylor garage. ...In an effort to locate William Desmond Taylor's lost will Public Administrator Frank Bryson Friday began a search of safety deposit boxes in Los Angeles' 100 banks and bank branches. 'I have some of Taylor's keys,' Bryson said, 'but I don't know what they fit.' The keys were tried out on several safe deposit boxes in downtown banks Thursday but found not to fit... The Dope Dragon again reared its sinister crest in the Taylor murder mystery Friday. A peddler of narcotics, well known to the police, has disappeared from his Hollywood home, missing since about the day of the murder. None of his studio acquaintances are able to give a clue to his whereabouts. The man knew William Desmond Taylor well, although the picture director is not suspected of having been a drug addict. Taylor, like every other motion picture director, was thrown in contact with 'hop heads.' Among his acquaintances were women of the studios who were known to be addicted to dope. The mystery of the dope peddler's disappearance is believed of sufficient importance to warrant a rigid investigation. Among those slated for quizzing at the district attorney's office today are several acquaintances of the doper, who, it is hoped, may give some clue to his whereabouts. If he is found he will be asked to account for his whereabouts the night of Wednesday, February 1. If he can do this satisfactorily it will eliminate him from direct connection with the murder. Then he will be closely questioned about any women patrons who were friends of Taylor.
1922-02-10	The field of suspects in the Taylor murder mystery is narrowed down to four men and Miss X--mysterious and unknown woman, in an analysis of experts, made Friday. Random clues, reports of William Desmond Taylor's past life and love affairs, letters disappearing and reappearing, handkerchiefs and the 'pink silk nightie'--all were consolidated today into a single mass of evidence. District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine is in command of the various agencies searching for Taylor's slayer. All new evidence unearthed will be placed at his disposal. Suspect Number One The first of the men suspects is Edward F. Sands, who according to one theory might have both planned and executed the crime. He is being sought by one branch of investigators as the possible murderer because Taylor had threatened him with prosecution on grand larceny charges. The blackmail theory involves this former servant. Taylor, bank records show, drew out $2500 a day or so before the murder and then returned it to the bank the day of the shooting. This, according to the police, might indicate that Taylor had decided to play blackmail, then changed his mind and refused the demands at the last minute and met his death refusing them. Suspect Number Two The second man upon which the attention of the combined investigators centered is the idle son of a multi-millionaire eastern manufacturer who is said to have been desperately in love with the actress whose dainty nightgown was found among Taylor's possessions following the tragedy. This young man is said to have come from the east a few months ago and to have been loitering about the fringe of the California movie colony, attracted by the actress. He is reported to have been secretly betrothed to the owner of the 'pink silk nightie.' Suspect Number Three The third man who was included in the list of possible suspects was today described as an 'independent motion picture figure' whose phenomenal rise within the last five years has been one of the most remarkable accomplishments of the motion picture industry. He was said to have been under investigation from the first. It is said he was in love with the same actress mentioned in connection with the 'young man from the east' and to have been divorced by his wife because of infidelity. The Woman Angle Another motion picture executive is referred to as 'Suspect No. 4.' The mysterious Miss X is not a pointed reference to any one actress among those of Taylor's acquaintances. She is merely the police theory that a jealous woman instigated the slaying of the director.
1922-02-10	STARTS NEW INQUIRY OF TAYLOR MURDER District Attorney Begins Reexamination of All the witnesses in the Case. MISSING LETTERS FOUIND Sheriff's Office Announces That Sands has Now Been Eliminated Entirely. Special to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 9.-A new and sweeping investigation of the murder of William Desmond Taylor, motion picture director, was begun today by District Attorney Woolwine and Deputy District Attorney Doran. Henry Peavey. Taylor's servant, and Howard Fellows, his chauffeur, and others were questioned today and the investigation will include the re-examination of all the film actresses mentioned in the case. Peavey and Fellows were escorted to the District Attorneyss office by police detectives and behind locked doors made long statements. Doran announced that the other witnesses, including the actresses, will be called in rapid succession. He expects to uncover many new facts concerning the life of the slain director, and other details which will aid them in a solution of the crime. Following the questioning of Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean late today the Sheriff's office announced that it had eliminated Sands entirely from the Taylor case. Mrs. MacLean knew Sands and is positive that the man she saw leaving Taylor's apartments immediately after she heard the shot was not Sands. At the same time it was reported today that a revolver which may have been used in the murder of Taylor has been found. A man, whose name and address are known to investigators, was said to have found it near the Taylor home the day after the murder, and to have kept it without suspecting it might have been the weapon used in the slaying. Detectives were sent out to locate this man and to confirm his reported discovery. The gun was said to have been found in an alley, where Taylor's slayer may have thrown it in his flight. Missing Letters Are Found. The letters and telegrams written by Mabel Normand to Taylor, which had been missing for several days and which were located yesterday and turned over to Chief Deputy District Attorney W. C. Doran last night, were inspected in secret today. Doran, who is working under the direction of Disstrict Attorney Woolwine, read the letters and telegrams in his office, but declined to make their contents public or to comment upon their contents. The letters and telegrams formed a fair-seized package. Doran declined to state where they had been found. With the letters and telegrams Doran received a woman's handkerchief, a dainty place and silk piece with the initials M. M. M. embroidered in one corner. The handkerchief was found among Taylor's effects and will be retained at the District Attorney's office during the investigation. Rumors that the District Attorney's office has undertaken an investigation of reports that thousands of dollars are being spent by motion picture interests to quiet the investigation of Taylor's death were denied today. Doran stated that police detectives and others have been in close touch with the District Attorney's office and that no attempts to block the investigation had been encountered by him so far. The fact that the District Attorney's office has taken charge of the investigation is said to please motion picture officials interested in the case, With Woolwine and Doran in charge the investigation will proceed systematically, it is said, and without unwarranted suspicion being directed against innocent persons. Police Detectives Herman Cline, Walter Murphy, J.E. Winn, F. B. Cato and William Cahill, who have been working on the case under Captain of Detectives Dave Adams, announced that they had been turning over every bit of evidence they have found to Doran, and that from now on they will continue to report to the District Attomey's office." Detective Sergeant E.R. King, assigned to the District Attorney's office, was today at work on a "new lead" which may result in the arrest of a man said to have been a close friend of the slain director. King investigation was in line with the work of the District Attorney's office and he declined to give information concerning the man he was seeking. Plan complete Co-operation. Complete coroperation between the police, the Sheriff's office and the Disstrict Attorney's office will mark the investigation from today on. Plans to work out the solution of the case, which appeared near in view of the centralized efforts, were made at a conference Taylor had sworn warrants for grand larceny and embezzlement. GOLDWYN DEFENDS MOWIES. Denies Industry is Trying to Suppress Facts in Taylor Murder. continued from Page I, Column S. in Doran's office attended by Captain of Detectives Adams, Sheriff Traeger and police detectives and deputy sheriffs who have been assigned to the investigation. New information concerning the man in a plaid cap and heavy muffler whom Mrs. Douglas MacLean saw fleeing from the Taylor house after the murder was supplied to detectives by Mrs. William McBurney, 710 South Alvarado Street. Mrs. McBurney said she and her husband saw a man answering the description of the man seen by Mrs. MacLean lurking in the shadows of heavy foliage near the Alvarado Hotel, two blocks away from Taylor's home, on the night of the murder. Mrs. McBurney said she saw the man about 9:45 o'clock, which was more than two hours after the time fixed by the police for the murder. It was considered probable today that the new County Grand jury will be impanelled soon at Woolwine's request to take up the Taylor investigation. This move will probably be made when the evidence accumulated by the District Attorney's office has reached a stage where an indictment or indictments can be requested. Word was received from San Diego during the day that the body of a suicide in the morgue there was believed to be Sands, but a later investigation developed that the dead man was not the missing servant against whom The motion picture industry should not be condemned because of one or two unfortunate occurrences, said Samuel Goldwyn, President of the Goldwyn Pictures Corporation, yesterday in a statement on the Taylor case. "The report that motion picture producers are attempting to suppress the true facts in the Taylor case would be too absurd to warrant comment," he said, "were it not that many thousands of people will read this report and believe it. as they have believed other false stories published about the motion picture industry. "The moving picture industry comprises a population greater than that of  almost any city in the world. No city ever gets through the year without many regrettable happenings. It is as unjust to say that the moving pictures need cleaning up as to speak of cleaning up the United States. "The good and helpful things the industry is doing for the betterment of the world are never chronicled on the front page, but let anybody connected with the movies get into trouble and not only he but the whole industry is in the headlines for many days. "When the industry was fortunate enough to secure so great an executive as Will H. Hays for co-operation in its problems, the wildest rumors of political plans and fantastic statements that he was to be insured for $2,000,000 were published everywhere. "I cannot ask the newspapers to ignore the occurrences in so important an activity, but I do ask the public to read these stories in their true perspective and realize that the moving picture industry is made of all sorts of people and that being a moving picture man or woman is no more indication of character than being a plumber, a steel man, a banker, a merchant or what not." 
1922-02-10	FIND NORMAND NOTES   Detectives Locate Love Letters. in Taylor 's Old Shoes.   DIRECTOR'S HOME SEARCHED Paper Clipping of Murder and Army Records Also Discovered.   Centralized Investigation opened by District Attorney-Testimony of Film Stars and Studio Manager Withheld-San Pedro Suicide, Suspected of Being Former Butler, Not Sands.   (By the Associated Press.) Los Angeles, Feb. 9. -A new and comprehensive investigation into the  circumstances surrounding the slaying of William Desmond Taylor, noted film director, was under way here today, directed by the district attorney. Yesterday and today the district attorney gathered into his hands the scattered threads of evidence that had been drawn out by the police, the sheriff 's office and independent investigators, and tonight he was attempting to weave them into some sort of pattera that would disclose what took place just before Taylor lost his life. One item gathered for this prospective fabric of fact and deduction! was a packet of letters written by Mabel Normand, motion picture actress, and which disappeared from Taylor 's home after his death. These  letters were rediscovered yesterday) concealed among Taylor 's effects. Their contents were not disclosed and Miss Normand, who was in seclusion today, declined to comment on the new turn of events.   Studio Manager Quizzed. Witnesses questioned today in the investigation, which it was announced would be complete and would takes other inquiries into consideration only so far as facts learned by them might be helpful, included Charles  Eyton, general manager of the Famous Players -Lasky studio here, at which Taylor was employed as at director. Mr. Eyton testified at the coroner 's inquest that he was the first to suspect that Taylor's death had been caused by other than natural events. He said he had insisted that the body be examined for wounds, and it was his insistence, according! to his statement at the inquest, that caused discovery of the fatal wound. Mr. Eyton had a conference today with the district attorney, Thomas L. Woolwine, and another one today in which W. C. Doran, an assistants district attorney, as well as Mr. Woolwine participated. Others summoned to the district attorney's office today and questioned included Mr. and Mrs. Douglas MacLean, whose home adjoined that of  Taylor, and who had given statements  at the inquest and to the police; Henry Peavy, Taylors houseman; Howard Fellows, chauffeur for Taylor, and Harry Fellows, brother of the chauffeur, and an assistant director. The district attorney declined to disclose the results of these interviews.   "Not Sands," Says Mrs. McLean. Mrs. Douglas McLean and her maid were said to have told the district attorney's representatives that a man they saw near the Taylor home the night of the slaying was not Edward F. Sands, the missing butler, nor Howard Fellows, Taylors chauffeur, who has stated he called atthe apartments that night in obedience to orders. Sheriff 's deputies working on the case obtained similar statements from  Mrs. MeLean and her maid and have announced their conclusion that "these eliminate Sands as a suspect." Mary Miles Minter, film actress. formerly directed by Taylor and said to have been a close friend, announced through her attorney her readiness to assist the officers of the police department and the district attorney's office in any possible manner.    Knows Nothing to Tell. "Miss Minter has given the officers of the police department and the disstrict attorney's office all the information she could," said her attorney. "She has refused to talk to newspaper men because the strain of the last few days has been great and because there is nothing she can tell them that will assist in the solution of the crime beyond a clear account of what little she knows, given to the proper authorities. "She knows of nothing that can be considered evidence, but she placed herself at the disposal of the investigators and is willing to supply any! information she may possess."   Rumor of Finding Gun. Another development today was a well defined rumor that some person had found a revolver, possibly the weapon with which Taylor was slain, shortly after the murder became known. This rumor was brought to the attention of the district attorney and the police, both offices disciaiming any direct knowledge of the purported discovery, but both saying that cognizance was being taken of the rumor and efforts made to prove he for disprove it. CONTINUED ON FOWRTH PACE.   FIND NORMAND NOTES CONTINUED FROM FIRST PACE.   While these local developments kept  the officials engaged, word came that the San Diego authorities believed the body of a suicide lying in the morgue there might be that of Edward F. Sands, missing houseman, against whom Taylor swore out warrants for grand larceny and embezzlement, and who has been sought earnestly by officers eager to learn what he knew of the murder. Investigation, however, developed that the dead man was not Sands. It also was announced today that the public administrator was searching for a second safe deposit box held by Taylor. One was found and opened its contents being negligible. There was no direct evidence that he had another box, but the authorities  said many men divided their documents in two or three boxes, and it he was possible that the search would yield something. Inventory of Taylor 's estate so far located has disclosed little except some automobiles, personal effects, and a small amount of cash.   Letters Hidden In Boot. The letters, for which Miss Nor mand searched Taylor 's apartments vainly, were found in a boot in a closet in the Taylor home by detectives, it was said. A final search through Taylorss apartments by the public administrator disclosed hidden in a leather case, a newspaper clipping of the slaying here within the last few months of Leon J. Manfre, also known as Mumfria, by Mrs. Esther Alhano. It gave details of the affair, together with  the alledged threat of the dead man that he would kill Mrs. Albano, "as he bad killed her husband," unless she gave him $500 and her jewelry. Another find was the original manuscript of the scenario of "Anne of Green Gables," the first motion picture in which Mary Miles Minter was starred, and which was directed by Taylor several years ago. It was said that the initials "C. C. C" appeared frequently on stubbs in Taylor 's check books, alse found in the apartments. District Attorney Woolwine, it was angouneed, turned the case of Mrs. Madalynne Conner Obenchain, on trial for murder, over to his chief deputy, and devoted his attention to the mo  tion picture colony murder. Complex angles of acts that occurred since the murder which investigators say give strong indications of connection with the murder itself, were placed under exhaustive scrutiny. Central Investigation Outlined. The centralized investigation will be carried on as follows: Questioning of several wealthy and  infinential producers, one of whom has been questioned before in the case. Questioning of at least four motion picture actresses, in an effort to develop further information concerning the Theory of a woman being the mo tive for the slayang Questioning of two men, not con nected with motion pictures, also lines of "jealousy," as a motive in the case. Close examination of former employes of the slain director in order to reveal intimacies of the past came under their observation Unexplained circumstances surround movements of the packet of letters, including letters from Mabel Normand to Taylor, which was found by a police detective in the Taylor house yesterday.   Miss Normand 's visit. Aabel Normand, who was in com pany with Taylor until 7:30 o'clock on Wednesday night a week ago, within an hour of the time which investigators fixed as the time of the murder, visited the house the following morning and sought these letters. She said they might be misinterpreted if read by the public, but denied that a love affair existed between Taylor herself. Two days ago reports were prevalent that the letters had been returned to Mabel Normand and other letters written by Mary Miles Minter had been returned to her. Statements were issued in behalf of each actress denying that any letters were returned to them. Henry Peavey, Taylor's negro houseman, who found the body of the morning after the shooting took place, was brought into police headquarters for further exarinatio detectives.   Houseman Finds Handkerchief. He was present at the public administrators removal of effects from the Taylor house and during the progress of the removal announced that he had made a find. "Here's the handkerchief all you boys have been bothering about," he said. "it was a dainty woman 's handgerchief with the initials "M. M. M." in a corner. Peavey, following an hour closeted with police detectives, was taken by them to the district attorney' s office.   Army Papers Found. Army records and papers found today in the home of Taylor prove, according to officials of the Famous Players-Lasky company, that the  murdered film director, was at least a lieutenant, if not a captain, as claimed, in the British forces during the world war. Among the records was a pass of leave from duty in Dunkirk, dated April 4, 1919, naming Taylor at that time as a lieutenant. An embarkatien ticket, bearing the name of William D. Tayior, the officials stated, showed also that he was a lieutenant. It bore the army number F-56979 and the regiment EFC, RASC. It is further stated Taylor was discharged with the rank of captain. Efforts to trace Taylors army record are being made in London.
1922-02-10	Hollwood Proves Magnet For All Ranks of Society   Every Type of Character and Morality Is Mingled by Lure of Motion Picture Fame. Hundreds Live Like Other Ordinary American FamiliesSudden Prosperity of Some Said to Be Cause of Seamy Incidents.   Los Angeles, Feb. 9 (By the Asso ciated Press). The recent murder of William Desmond Taylor, widely known motion picture director, has caused public attention to turn toward the motion picture colony at Hollywood here, and numerous inquiries about that colony and the life of its people have followed. Hollywood as the general name assigned to a section of Los Angeles lying about 8 miles from the downtown business section. Many motion picture studias are scattered through Hollywood and thousands of persons from all classes of society are employed at the studios. Where so many types are gathered, there are all variations of character and morality. Some of those who come to the lots as humble extras succeed because of some trait of personality in reaching stardom almost before they have become known generally in the industry itself.   Reasons for Advance. Sometimes it is real ability that drives them upward. Sometimes it is the favor of director or preducer: sometimes it is a pair of cross-eyes or funny legs or unusual size that provide the needed leverage for the lift to success. When people spring from poverty to affluence, often within a few weeks, their mental equipment is not always equal to the strain. They have money, an unaccustomed toy, and they spend it in bizarre ways. They may buy automobiles of the usual 'styles and finish, known in the trade here as "movie trick machines," or they may take to having "wild parties," or they may indulge in other forms of relaxation and excitement. Many of them spend all they make. One well-known male stare testified in the divorce court recently that he was getting $700 a week: he said he had $700 in bank as pay day had just passed: that he had three automobiles, an extensive wardrobe and no other assets.   Many Turn to Drink. Many of them come in from other work, in which habits, have become fixed on them. In the preprohibition days there were many "country clubs" and all-night restaurants that drew a heavy patrenage from the ranks of motion-picture people. They went there to see each other and to be seen by each other and the public. Sometimes they drank a good deal. Sometimes very little. Since prohibition came in many of them who had no liquor stocks turned to other stimulants.  The dealers in lllicit drugs found a growing clientele. With liquor, and to some extent drugs, there were some few who combined irregular relations in life. Motion picture people themselves admit that immoral and sometimes perverted persons are to be found in the industry, but they insist that the percentage of these is relatively small and that only their position in the public eye has made them at all conspicuous. It is not denied that some drug users are connected with the industry, but the producers take the position that these persons are being eliminated as opportunity offers.   Prejudice Against Film People. These various conditions have caused the property owners in Hollywood and in other sections to look on some motion picture people with disfavor when they seek to rent property. The owners have even advertised rental property with the phrase, "no movies wanted," and in many instances leases are made with the provision that all damage done by the tenant shall be repaired. There are, however, scores and hundreds of motion picture people who live lives in no way dissimilar to those  of other American householders, they go to the studios, do their work, return to normal homes and spend their evenings at theaters, at home, at clubs or in ordinary pursuits. Many of them have purchased handsome homes: many of them saw war service; many of them were-and areholders of liberty bonds and other investments. Some of them are regular church attendants and some of them are church officials. The industry numbers in its ranks all sorts of people, with all sorts of training and education; in the same set it is possible to see a noted actor   -director with a collegebred scenario writer at his elbow, directing a scene in which the leading woman may be one who fought her way up from an old-time burlesque choras while her leading man may have stepped from a bank or even a pulpit almost directly to a star's position, because of some charm of feature or superiority of physique. A violinist may kneel at one side, playing said music to help the star to tears, while a short -sleeved mechanic with drooping cigarette and protrading jaws stands by his light switehes. Everybody has heard the query, "Whats the matter with the movies," and observers in Los Angeles thinkthey know the answer. In their beief the trouble with the motion-picsure industry is the presence within it of a relatively small proportion of people whose senses were beclouded by sudden prosperity: the back of deand on the part of the producers for a standard of morality to be observed by their employes: the lack of thrift and the presence of extravagance, and the fact that the character has not been demanded by either producers or public as an element of success.

'He was here in the afternoon to attend some business,' she explained. 'I do not think there is a woman in the case. 'Why--' her white hand pointed to a large picture of Mary Miles Minter that was hanging on the wall of her room. 'Of course little Mary loved Mr. Taylor--who didn't? We all loved him. 'Of course, Mary Miles Minter is only a child. 'Her letters, published, are purely those of a very young girl, and as Mr. Taylor said, 'a child.' 'I had asked him how she was on that day he called here and he said 'she has a touch of tonsillitis and temperament.' '
1922-02-11	A young New Yorker, whose father is a wealthy manufacturer, has been brought under suspicion because of his devotion to the same pretty actress. He has been hanging around Hollywood, and reports, now believed to have had their inception in his own love-sick brain, that he was engaged to the actress, have been circulated. He was questioned early in the police investigation and gave what appeared to be a satisfactory story of his whereabouts. Persons whose names he brought into the statement of his movements on the night in question have contradicted him, according to the investigators, and this has brought him under the shadow again.

1922-02-11	An assassin hired by a motion picture leader, member of an alleged 'dope ring,' killed William Desmond Taylor, in the opinion of Ruth Wing Taylor, wife of Ted Taylor, the dead director's publicity agent. Psychics have aided her in reaching her theory, Mrs. Taylor, who before her marriage was a screen actress, said. She explained: 'Since Mr. Taylor was killed, two persons of the highest standing in the study of the occult have come to me, saying that they believe I held the key to the murder. 'Things have come to me, one by one, that have convinced me that Mr. Taylor was slain by a hired assassin, paid by a certain noted picture leader, whose money, I believe, has been able to purchase a quieting of suspicion and immunity from investigation. 'It is true the authorities have conducted a superficial investigation into his movements, but this psychic power within me tells me that he is the one responsible. The only woman with whom he has been really in love for several years was friendly toward Taylor and I believe he conceived this plan to rid himself of Taylor, whom he believed his rival for the woman's affections but who actually was interested in her only from a more or less intellectual standpoint.'

1922-02-11	There is no secret about any phase of my relations with Mr. Taylor. My letters to him--I would gladly set them before the world if the authorities care to do that. I have nothing to conceal. 'I knew Mr. Taylor had letters of mine. Once several weeks before he was murdered I saw them in a drawer of his desk. I remonstrated with him. `Why do you save my letters, Billy? I asked. There's nothing in them.' He merely smiled in answer. 'I have been charged with trying to recover those letters; with trying to conceal them. That is silly. If those letters are printed you will see that they are most of them casual; they express the jesting spirit that characterized our relations. We teased each other and made fun of each other a great deal. We did that continually on the night he was murdered, when I dropped in for a few minutes to see him.' As for the letters, she said, he would write her: 'Dear Mabel: I know you're an awfully busy woman and haven't much time to grant a poor duffer like me, but--how about dinner together next Wednesday and then the Orpheum? 'Yours always, 'Billy.' And on one occasion she said she answered: 'Dear Desperate Desmond: 'Sorry I cannot dine with you tomorrow. But I have a previous engagement with a Hindoo Prince. Some other time.' 'Then,' she said, 'I would sign the letter with a little sketch of myself, or by drawing a `daffodil.' You know the daffodils, those funny little comic figures.' 'Or he would write to me about books. I just want to show you some of the books he gave me.'
1922-02-11	I then directed William, my chauffeur, to drive to Mr. Taylor's home. I arrived, went up on the porch, and the door was opened by Mr. Taylor's valet, Henry Peavey. I saw Taylor inside talking on the phone, and when Henry asked me to step in, I refrained because I didn't want to eavesdrop on his conversation. 'Then Henry went inside and told Mr. Taylor I was there. At once he said good-by, hung up the phone and came forward to greet me.' 'I know why you're here,' he said. 'You haven't come to see me at all; you've just come after that book!' 'The book was `Rosmundy,' by Ethel M. Dell. It was not a copy of one of Freud's works as has been said. I read Freud and Nietzche long before I met Mr. Taylor. 'For some time Mr. Taylor and I spoofed each other in our usual way, while Henry worked about the back part of the house. I looked about and said, `This place has changed since I saw it last. I see you have both a piano and Victrola now. My, you're getting all together too rich.' 'Then we discussed books. We discussed `Three Soldiers,' a book that Chicago newspaper man, John Dos Passos. He had read it only recently and was much interested. And several other new books came into the discussion. 'When Henry Peavey entered I stared at him in amusement. I stared at his curious attire. He wore green golf stockings, yellow knickers and a dark coat. He left by the front door, smiling broadly and saying good night to me and Mr. Taylor. The way he said it--he's a funny colored boy with lots of mannerisms--made me smile. 'When Henry had gone I said, `Why don't you get him a set of golf sticks? Then he'd be all set up.' 'Mr. Taylor's face grew serious then and he discussed Henry at some length, telling me how Henry had been arrested a short time before and how he had gone down to see the judge about the vagrancy charge. And how he had put up a bond of $200 to secure Henry's release.
1922-02-11	Feb. 10--...another Chicagoan, Mrs. John H. Borden, close friend of Mabel Normand, was rising to the latter's defense. She returned here a month ago after a five months' visit with Mabel Normand. 'Mabel is not in love and never was in love with Taylor,' she said. 'Bill Taylor was in love with her, very much so, but it was unrequited. She had been engaged to Mack Sennett, but that was an old affair and now they are merely good friends. Mabel did not know anything about the first Mrs. Taylor or the daughter. 'Mabel never mentioned Mary Miles Minter's name to me. If there had been an affair between Taylor and Miss Minter I believe Mabel would have told me. 'And as to those 'baby' letters, I read them to Mabel over the telephone when she was away. If she had been in love she would never have allowed me to do that. As far as Mabel Normand is concerned, I can say and know that she is not 'wild,' and that her work and her screen ambitions are too big in her life to let anything in the world interfere.'
1922-02-11	A man believed by the police to be a material witness in the Taylor murder case was arrested here last night. He was charged with a felony pending further investigation into his story. Armed with a search warrant, two detectives made a hurried trip early this morning, following an absence for more than two hours from the conference in the District Attorney's office. Their mission followed the arrest and no indication of their plans was given. Mabel Normand, film-star friend of William Desmond Taylor, the slain motion-picture director whose murder more than a week ago continues to baffle the police, last night was questioned for hours in the District Attorney's office. She was the second woman star of considerable magnitude in filmdom to be questioned, the first being Mary Miles Minter. Miss Normand, the last friend, it is believed, who saw Mr. Taylor alive, was closeted with Dist.-Atty. Woolwine, Chief Deputy Doran and police detectives from 8:15 p.m. until midnight. She was driven to the office by her chauffeur, William Davis, an important witness in the case whose statements thus far have corroborated Miss Normand' story that Mr. Taylor accompanied her to her automobile when she left him a few minutes before he was shot through the back in his bachelor apartments. Mr. Davis was questioned after Miss Normand. 'I have seldom seen a case so devoid of workable or substantial clews as is this one,' Mr. Woolwine stated at the close of the four-hour session. Little additional information that had not previously been told to officers and also in the columns of The Times was gleaned from the statement last night of Miss Normand. Her story has been told and retold by her and in all essential points there was no variation during the long questioning. She said she went to Mr. Taylor's apartments to get a book at his request. She retold the substance of their conversation. Then she left about 7:45 p.m. He took her to her automobile, talked for a few minutes, waved good-by and turned toward his home as she left in her automobile. It was a very few moments after this he was shot. After her long statement she left Mr. Woolwine's office, apparently well at ease, her lips a deep crimson, giving more than a mere suspicion of a camera-proof make-up. She obligingly permitted cameramen to 'flash' the scene as she walked down the corridor with Messers. Woolwine and Doran at her side. She laughed frequently--all the party seemed in good spirits. During the long conference with Miss Normand, the much-discussed letters written to Mr. Taylor by her and not found in the house until a few days after the murder, were taken into the room where she was making a statement. Mr. Doran took them from his office at another end of the hall. He remained in the room where Miss Normand was about thirty minutes and then Mr. Doran, with the packet of letters in his pocket, walked again to his office. On the return trip his pocket was empty. Despite this definite indication that Mr. Woolwine will retain possession of the letters for the time being at least, there is nothing in them, he stated, that seems to throw light on the crime or motive behind the slaying. Just before Miss Normand's questioning was concluded, Mr. Woolwine came out of the room and said that in his opinion Miss Normand was very anxious to assist in every way to find the slayer. 'I may be mistaken,' he said, 'but I now have the opinion she is anxious to assist us in every way.' Flanked on both sides and with a rear and front guard of police detectives, Miss Normand displayed a remarkable shyness for cameramen when she entered the Hall of Records at 7:55 o'clock last night. She was also accompanied by A. MacArthur, her personal representative, and a friend, who gave her name as Miss Burns. When the members of the party got to the eleventh floor, where Mr. Woolwine's office is situated, no one was there to receive them. So Miss Normand, one of the queens of the screen, sat in one of the straight-backed, uncomfortable chairs in the hallway, waiting twenty minutes for her interrogators to appear. During that wait she made a statement for the press... During the waiting in the hall Miss Normand, who was attired in a gray velour hat, fur neck piece, red coat, gray hose and black Oxfords, joked with the officers. She was declared to have left a sick-bed to accommodate the officials making the murder inquiry. Late in the day it was reported she had a severe collapse, but Mr. MacArthur stated she merely was ill and had not actually collapsed. Mr. Woolwine, accompanied by Mr. Doran and Ben Smith, official shorthand reporter, came to the office twenty minutes after Miss Normand. Mr. Woolwine walked toward her party. 'Good evening, Miss Normand,' he said. 'How are you feeling tonight?' 'I haven't been feeling very well today,' she replied. They all went into Mr. Woolwine's office, but Miss Normand's two companions remained in the anteroom during the taking of her statement. About half an hour later, Detective Sergeants Cato and Cahill left the building on an unexplained mission, remaining away for several hours. Mr. Woolwine later said this trip was not the outgrowth of new information from Miss Normand and that nothing definite was developed. Mr. Davis, the chauffeur, remained downstairs during the questioning of his employer. Just an hour after the conference started, Mr. Doran made the trips referred to above with the Normand letters. When he returned them to his office, Mr. Woolwine followed him out of the room where Miss Normand was being questioned, and held a brief consultation with him. Earlier in the day, six witnesses were examined by the officers on the case. One of them is a nurse who declared she saw a man wearing a cap and a muffler who was watching Miss Normand and Mr. Taylor as the couple were standing near Miss Normand's machine. The strange man, whose description is said to coincide with that of the man seen leaving Mr. Taylor's apartments after the shot was heard, was standing in the shadow of some brush, the woman said. Other witnesses whose statements were taken during the day were not named by the investigators, nor was the nature of their testimony learned. In addition to the Normand letters received at the District Attorney's office a few days ago, Mr. Woolwine yesterday obtained possession of other letters taken from the home of persons not officially permitted to remove them. Among these were letters from Mary Miles Minter and many canceled checks and other personal property. Mr. Woolwine, late in the day, said he had personally examined all this material and had been unable to find anything which in itself aided in solving the mystery of who shot Mr. Taylor and why. Detective Sergeant King, working out of the District Attorney's office, was reported at his home to be seriously ill and not able to continue his work investigating the case. Charles A. Jones, retired Chief of Police and formerly an investigator aiding Mr. Woolwine, was in conference a long time during the afternoon with Mr. Woolwine and the others who are trying to find the slayer. And the conclusion of a 'bonehead conference,' as he termed a meeting in the afternoon with police detectives, Dist.-Atty. Woolwine said that no clews had been found which would directly lead to a solution of the mystery. In addition to making a personal tour of the scene of the crime during the morning hours and to sitting in at several conferences, Dist.-Atty. Woolwine added several new elements to the murder mystery. He introduced late in the day a new and hitherto unmentioned witness into the case, whose identity was guarded with the utmost secrecy. The mystery witness, a man who thus far has failed to appear in any phase of the baffling investigation, was spirited into the District Attorney's office late in the afternoon. Earlier in the day Chief Deputy Dist.-Atty. Doran had hastily left the Hall of Records on a secret mission, accompanied by a shorthand reporter and Detective Sergeants Winn and Murphy. It was thought they were to visit Mabel Normand's apartment to get a shorthand statement from her. Several hours later Chief Deputy Dist.-Atty. Doran returned, bringing with him the unknown witness. The man was escorted into a room, the door was locked and he was questioned for an hour. The officials who heard his statement refused to reveal his identity or to relate what had occurred behind the locked door. An official conference was held late in the afternoon. Those present included Dist.-Atty. Woolwine, Chief Dep. Dist.-Atty. Doran and the detectives. Mr. Woolwine gave the session the name of 'bonehead conference,' he explained, because he had concluded that none of the investigators, including himself, had been able to reach any solution of the crime. He said that no person was under suspicion, despite the fact that several prominent film persons had been interviewed, that not even a motive has been established, that he has not been able to form a definite theory that might aid them in the investigation. Mr. Woolwine verified the report in The Times yesterday morning that Mary Miles Minter had made a statement for the District Attorney's office. The questioning, he stated, was conducted last Tuesday afternoon by Mr. Doran, who refused to divulge the nature of the written statement which a shorthand reporter took from Miss Minter. While Mr. Woolwine was considering what steps he should next take in his personal investigation, Capt. of Detectives Adams and Detective Sergeant Herman Cline made a hurried trip to San Diego to investigate the suicide of a man who at first was reported to answer the description of Edward F. Sands, former valet employed by Taylor and who is sought in connection with the crime. The suicide had registered under the name of James Martin at a San Diego hotel. Last Monday his body was found in his room. Also it was learned that he had a bank account of $260 in a Los Angeles bank. His description, Coroner Kelly reported, tallied with that of Sands. After viewing the body, Capt. Adams announced he was positive the man in the San Diego morgue was not Sands. He returned to Los Angeles last night...
1922-02-11	An official investigation is under way by the Motion-Picture Directors' Association, President David M. Hartford announced last evening, of a proposition reported to have been made to a prominent motion-picture actor here that he should drop out of sight under circumstances calculated to make it appear that he is the murderer of William Desmond Taylor. The extraordinary situation first became public at a largely attended meeting of the Motion-Picture Directors' Association at the Hollywood Women's clubhouse Thursday evening. A well-known director stated from the floor, according to others present, that the film actor, with whom he is associated, had been approached by two representatives of a local newspaper and the proposition made to him that he should, in effect, assume the guilt for Taylor's murder for the time being. The plan behind the proposal, according to the understanding, was that the star would get very usable 'publicity' and the newspaper 'sensational copy.' It all was to be arranged by the return of the actor after a proper period of time, and his exoneration by proper alibis. In the meantime the authorities could be seeking the real murderer of the director if they saw fit in face of the apparent guilt of the missing star. The actor refused the proposal with indignation, and nothing more came of the matter until it was brought out at the meeting Thursday night. Mr. Hartford, who is the newly elected head of the Directors' Association, said the matter had not been brought up officially, but he considered it of sufficient importance to began an inquiry yesterday.
1922-02-11	Mabel Normand, famous film star, before going into the office of Thomas Lee Woolwine, District Attorney, last night, to be questioned as to any clew she might be able to furnish to the identity of the slayer of William Desmond Taylor, motion-picture director, issued a statement through her manager that she could 'not offer any solution whatever' concerning the tragedy and denied that she was in love with Taylor, or had quarreled with him. 'No one will ever know how I regret the terrible tragedy. I have told truthfully everything I know and am very sorry, indeed. I cannot offer any solution whatever as to the motive which prompted the terrible deed. I have satisfied the Los Angeles authorities, both police and District Attorney's office, that I know nothing about the murder, and have offered my services or a statement at any time I may be called to help apprehend the assassin. 'The handkerchief and gown found in Mr. Taylor's apartment have been identified as other than mine. It has been established that I was not in love with Mr. Taylor; that he escorted me to my car that evening and chatted until I drove away, when we waved good-by to each other. 'Please tell the public that I knew absolutely nothing about this terrible happening and that Mr. Taylor and I did not quarrel.'
1922-02-11	A man working in Hollywood who requested his name not be mentioned in connection with the matter, stated to an Examiner reporter yesterday that on Tuesday afternoon, January 31, about 3 o'clock he was walking down Hollywood boulevard between Gower and Vine streets and that a man who tallies with the description of the one seen by Mrs. MacLean at the Taylor house on the night of the murder stopped him and inquired the way to the Lasky studio. 'The man seemed to want to talk to some one,' said the person giving this piece of news, 'and while we were engaged in conversation he asked me if I knew William D. Taylor. He said Taylor was a director at Lasky's. I told him I had never heard of the man and he expressed surprise and said he was very well known. The man said he wrote scenarios and poetry and he had a whole bunch of papers in his hand which he wanted to read to me, but poetry not being in my line I told him I was in a hurry. 'The man was short and heavy set. He wore dark brown clothes and a soft hat of the same color. He had on very heavy shoes, sort of brogans, and he looked about 25 years old. As he walked away I noticed he was bow-legged. He had a round, full face and looked to be about five feet nine inches in height. 'The man also asked about a car to town and said he believed he would take the next one, and then changed his mind, and acted, I thought, in a peculiar manner. I did not think of telling this until I read of Mr. Taylor's murder and later read the description of the man in the paper.'
1922-02-11	Mabel Normand sat in her bungalow court apartment, 3089 West Seventh street, yesterday afternoon and for two hours went over in detail the story of her friendship for Taylor, of her last visit to his house on the night of the murder, and of the famous 'Blessed Baby' letters which Miss Normand and Taylor wrote to each other. She discussed the general tone of the letters and recited a number of them in detail from memory. She went over the conversation she had had with Taylor a few moments before he was murdered, giving every sentence, she declared, that had passed between them. Miss Normand rose from a sick bed to grant the interview. For two days she has been on the verge of collapse. She talked to an Examiner reporter, nevertheless, against the advice of her business manager who feared for her physical condition. 'You'll not see the Mabel Normand you know on the screen,' said her manager, MacArthur, while we were waiting for her to appear. 'This terrible case has played havoc with her nerves.' The film star appeared in negligee, her hair down her back in school girl braids. Her face was pale and her voice trembled with emotion when she mentioned Taylor. 'I will talk freely to you. I will tell you everything I know about this terrible case,' she said in starting. 'And I ask only one thing in return. Print truthfully what I say. So much that is untrue has been printed about me. 'There is no secret about any phase of my relations with Mr. Taylor. My letters to him--I would gladly set them before the world if the authorities care to do that. I have nothing to conceal. 'I knew Mr. Taylor had letters of mine. Once several weeks before he was murdered I saw them in a drawer of his desk. I remonstrated with him. 'Why do you save my letters, Billy?' I asked. 'There's nothing in them.' He merely smiled in answer. 'I have been charged with trying to recover those letters; with trying to conceal them. That is silly. If those letters are printed you will see that they are most of them casual; they express the jesting spirit that characterized our relations. We teased each other and made fun of each a great deal. We did that continually on the night he was murdered, when I dropped in for a few minutes to see him' As for the letters, she said, he would write her: 'Dear Mabel: I know you're an awfully busy woman and haven't much time to grant to a poor duffer like me, but--how about dinner together next Wednesday and then the Orpheum' Yours always, 'Billy.' And on one occasion she said she answered: 'Dear Desperate Desmond: Sorry I cannot dine with you tomorrow. But I have a previous engagement with a Hindoo Prince. Some other time.' 'Then,' she said, 'I would sign the letter with a little sketch of myself, or by drawing a 'daffodil.' You know the daffodils, those funny little comic figures. 'Or he would write to me about books. I just want to show you some of the books he gave me.' Miss Normand rose and picked up a costly illustrated volume descriptive of the Russian Ballet. Then another large book describing dress throughout the ages. 'I should like to deny a number of things that have been charged against me,' said Miss Normand. 'First that I had told some one that I expected to marry Mr. Taylor. I never said that. Secondly, that I was with him on New Year's Eve at the Ambassador Hotel and that we quarreled afterward. 'On New Year's Even I was at the Alexandria hotel with Mr. and Mrs. Mahlon Hamilton. I did not see Mr. Taylor that night.' 'Did you quarrel with him on any other night after returning from a party or from dinner? And did he return any jewels to you?' 'I never quarreled with him. And he did not return any jewelry to me. 'Then there's the story of the night dress found in Mr. Taylor's apartment. It is cruel for any one to insinuate that it belonged to me. The initials, which I understand were found on it, refute that. The night of Mr. Taylor's death was the only time I was ever alone with him in his house. 'It has been said that check stubs found on Mr. Taylor's desk and the fact that he had drawn some money from the bank just before he was killed would indicate that perhaps someone was trying to blackmail him. I don't believe it. He had his check book out that night and was going over his checks for one reason only. 'Ever since Sands, his former butler, had forged his name Mr. Taylor had examined every check that came in carefully. He told me that he could hardly tell Sands' forgeries from his own signatures, and he was afraid that the swindling was going on all along. 'On the night of the murder, contrary to what has been said, he was in excellent spirits. During the time that I was with him I heard no sound that would indicate that any one was hiding in the house, anyone who might have stepped out and killed him after I left. But I will go back to the first part of that story of our last evening and give it to you all in detail. 'In the afternoon I went to a jewelry store to have initials placed on a vanity bag of mine. Then I went to the bank to deposit some checks. I'm rather careless about money and sometimes I let my checks accumulate--don't deposit them each week. It was so in this case. 'At the bank I phoned home to my maid, who told me that Mr. Taylor had called up. She said he mentioned having a book for me. I left the bank, bought 50 cents worth of peanuts from a man on the corner, several magazines and stepped into my limousine. 'I then directed William, my chauffeur, to drive to Mr. Taylor's home. I arrived, went up on the porch, and the door was opened by Mr. Taylor's valet, Henry Peavey. I saw Mr. Taylor inside talking on the phone, and when Henry asked me to step in, I refrained because I didn't want to eavesdrop on his conversation. 'Then Henry went inside, and told Mr. Taylor I was there. At once he said good-by, hung up the phone and came forward to greet me. ''I know why you're here,' he said. 'You haven't come to see me at all; you've just come after that book!' 'The book was 'Rosmundy,' [sic] by Ethel M. Dell. It was not a copy of one of Freud's works, as has been said. I read Freud and Nietzche long before I met Mr. Taylor. 'For some time Mr. Taylor and I 'spoofed' each other in our usual way, while Henry worked about the back part of the house. I looked about and said, 'This place has changed since I saw it last. I see you have both a piano and a Victrola now. My, you're getting altogether too rich.' 'Then we discussed books. We discussed 'Three Soldiers,' a book by that Chicago newspaper man, John Dos Passos. He had read it only recently and was much interested. And several other new books came into the discussion. 'When Henry Peavey entered I stared at him in amusement. I stared at his curious attire. He wore green golf stockings, yellow knickers and a dark coat. He left by the front door, smiling broadly and saying good night to me and Mr. Taylor. The way he said it--he's a funny colored boy with lots of mannerisms--made me smile. 'When Henry had gone I said, 'Why don't you get him a set of golf sticks? Then he'd be all set up.' 'Mr. Taylor's face grew serious then and he discussed Henry at some length, telling me how Henry had been arrested a short time before and how he had gone down to see the judge about the vagrancy charge. And how he had put up a bond of $200 to secure Henry's release. 'Then the talk turned on dinner and Mr. Taylor tried to persuade me to stay, saying that he had my favorite dessert--rice pudding. But I declined, for I had to work the next morning and it is my custom to retire early whenever I have work ahead. 'So we started for the door. As we stepped out on the porch and walked down the pathway toward me car, he put his arm about me. At the car he saw the magazines I had bought. One magazine was the Police Gazette and he started to tease me about it. I told him that I had bought it with a number of other illustrated magazines simply to look over the pictures. 'His parting remark was about calling me up an hour later concerning the book he had given me. He was curious to know whether I would like it. 'He waved good-by and I saw him start back toward the house. The next morning Edna Purviance called up and told me that he was dead. 'And that is all that I know. That is all I can tell District Attorney Woolwine or any other of the authorities if they call me before them.'
1922-02-11	...Emerging at 11:30 last night from District Attorney Woolwine's inner office at the close of a four-hours' interrogation of Mabel Normand, Detective Sergeants Cato, Murphy, Cahill and Winn brought with him a cap which they said may prove to be that of the man seen near the home of William D. Taylor by Mrs. Douglas MacLean. This cap, regarded by the detectives as important enough to be taken by them into the conference with Miss Normand, was worn by a man arrested in the afternoon on East Fourth street by Detectives Roberts and Lloyd. He gave the name of Walter Thiele and is held at the city jail on suspicion of a burglary committed the night of the Taylor murder and for carrying a revolver. On the visor of the cap is a bloodstain. The cap itself is khaki color, with distinct seams that might cause it to be mistaken for plaid at night... Miss Normand, after the questioning, talked to reporters for a few minutes. 'I feel so relieved now that I have told my story--everything--to the District Attorney. I know by the expression on Mr. Woolwine's face and his kindly smile as I left that he has placed me absolutely in 'the clear.' 'I told him everything from the time I entered Mr. Taylor's apartment to get the book he was to lend me until the moment I left him at the curb and waved good-bye. He has heard by story and he smiled convincingly at its conclusion.' As she walked down the corridor, garbed in an attractive dark red suit of the latest pattern her step was light and her manner confident and cheerful. 'I'm so tired, so very tired,' the film star said to her chauffeur as she and her companions stepped into her limousine. 'Please drive us back to the house so I can get some rest after this ordeal.' 'Just tell them I know the district attorney has placed me in 'the clear,'' she called over her shoulder to a newspaperman who pressed her for an interview. 'Tell them I have offered to be the first one to help in tracing down this fiendish assassin and that I hope he is caught and punished.' And as the automobile of Mabel Normand sped on the district attorney had this to say: 'I believe that little girl has told me everything she knows about this case and she's giving us every bit of aid she can.' This followed a day during which Miss Normand's physicians had declared that she was not equal to the strain of an official interrogation. Then Woolwine himself had a telephone conversation with Miss Normand shortly before 7 o'clock. Anxious to avoid the crowd that would be attracted by a daytime visit to the district attorney's office, the film actress decided that she was strong enough to brave the ordeal and promised to come to the Hall of Records at once. 'Even after talking to all the people about this Taylor case, I have been unable to gather one bit of evidence that would produce a clew,' declared Woolwine at midnight, after the conference. 'Miss Normand talked freely and for a long while we discussed the case informally. She is a very bright girl and seemed perfectly willing to help in running down the person who killed Taylor. She says she is as much interested in solving the murder as we are. 'There was sincerity in her tone when she made her statement in the presence of a shorthand expert. 'Of all the baffling murders we have had in recent years, this is the most puzzling I have encountered in my career. 'That Elwell murder in New York, has many characteristics of this one. We haven't found one clew yet that will assist in tracing the murder. 'Sands? Of course, I want to talk to him. 'All the persons questioned so far have not given a clew--none whatever! 'I suspect no one yet; have eliminated none.'... To a question as to whether he had obtained from Miss Normand information apparently related to the murder itself which had not been printed, Woolwine answered: 'We have talked of many apparently irrelevant things not published in the newspapers, but up to this time I have gotten nothing not published that pertains directly to the murder.'... McArthur, the manager, told reporters that Miss Normand had been receiving about a hundred letters a day since the death of Taylor. Most of them were from friends and admirers, expressing their deepest sympathy, but a few each day were abusive or from cranks.'... 'Yes, the man wore a plaid cap and a muffler.' A woman other than Mrs. Douglas MacLean saw the mystery man in the William D. Taylor case, it developed yesterday--saw him just before the murder while watching the film director and Mabel Normand. This woman, a nurse, was walking south on Alvarado street about 7:30 o'clock on the evening of February 1. She recognized Mabel Normand from her pictures. She did not know Taylor, but has since satisfied herself that he was the man in this sidewalk conversation. She passed them. A few feet farther on she saw a man standing behind a clump of brush. The man was not more than thirty feet from the couple, and appeared to be watching them intently. 'How was he dressed?' asked the police detective of this newest and, until yesterday, revealed witness. 'I remember distinctly the plaid cap and the muffler,' she said. 'Would you be able to recognize him should you see him again?' 'I would.' This testimony regarded as more intimate than any yet issuing from the sterile ground of facts in the case, has not been vouchsafed by this woman heretofore because, as she excused herself, she 'did not know it was important.' Nevertheless it is considered vital in this, that it practically dismisses from consideration the idea that the murderer--if this man of the muffler were he--entered the apartment while Taylor and Miss Normand were in conversation. Hence, upon the basis of this new story the structural material of the crime must be rearranged and the murderer, in the revised version, is discovered entering after Miss Normand left... The District Attorney called no witnesses yesterday. In the morning he drove out to the apartment occupied by Taylor at 404-B South Alvarado street, accompanied by E. C. Jessurun, the owner; W. C. Doran, Chief Deputy District Attorney, and Walter Fischer, his chauffeur. Mr. Jessurun was the first person to enter the house after the discovery of the body by Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored valet. In order to have a picture of that setting, with the fidelity of detail maintained, the District Attorney secured from Mr. Jessurun a description of the scene as he had observed it. Jessurun placed Fischer on his back on the floor, with feet towards the front door, with the corner of the rug there turned back under one foot. The landlord straightened the chauffeur's arms by his sides, but he spread his legs slightly apart, as they had found Taylor lying. The chair in which Taylor sat as he talked to Miss Normand, Jessurun placed over one leg, with its two front legs between Fischer's and its back towards the wall. 'That is the way the body lay, just like that,' said the landlord... In a second statement the District Attorney observed that 'the investigation has been proceeding as well as might be expected, considering the fact that more than a week has elapsed since the commission of the crime.' 'Does the evidence point to Sands or does it eliminate him?' he was asked. 'It does not point to any one,' he replied. 'I have not gone far enough to intelligently conclude that this person or that person might have done it.' The District Attorney's attention was directed to a powerful motion picture producer and magnate who, it is well known, was in love with one of the actresses frequently mentioned in the investigation. It developed that many persons, even men in the police department, have been wondering why this man has never been questioned. It appears that for several days he has refused himself to nearly all visitors and has placed officers in his home to guard himself against intruders. This man is being considered as one who, on account of his very close relationship with the actress in question, might be able to give valuable information. A renewed search of safety deposit boxes of banks of the city was undertaken yesterday on the supposition that Taylor left a will, an intimation to this effect coming from his daughter, Ethel Daisy Tanner. If there is such a secret box it is also expected that it will yield up documents, letters or other matter which may help to clear up Taylor's past and possibly furnish facts tending to make clear the motive. Among Taylor's keys are a number which fit no locks in his house. One of them, according to the officers, is similar to those issued for safety deposit boxes... The theory that Taylor was murdered by a blackmailer was somewhat discounted yesterday when it was learned that he had been bartering with a salesman for diamonds upon which a price of $3000 had been set. The director, it is said, decided not to buy the jewels. It was this negotiation, it is assumed, which accounted for the withdrawal of $2500 by Taylor on January 31 and the redepositing of this sum on February 1. In other words, he withdrew the money to be paid to the salesman and put it back when the deal fell through... Among those scheduled for early interrogation are two chauffeurs--Miss Normand's and Taylor's. The latter, Ed Fowler, knew Sands and his statement is desired for any light it may throw upon the missing ex-secretary of the murdered man...
1922-02-11	...Dramatic in the extreme was the scene enacted today at the Taylor bungalow. Fischer, Woolwine's chauffeur, lay prone upon the floor, impersonating in death the murdered film director as he lay when found by Peavey, his Negro valet. Jessurun had been one of the first to arrive upon the scene when the murder was discovered on the morning of February 2. He saw to it today that the position of the chauffeur's body corresponded in every detail to that which had been Taylor's, and that all of the furniture was placed exactly as it had been found. Woolwine, after making the closest inspection of the premises, gave official utterance, for the first time, to the theory that the murderer, man or woman, was concealed in the bungalow at the time that Mabel Normand and Taylor were engaged in conversation. He or she may have been upstairs in the bedroom, have overheard the talk, and, upon Taylor's return from the curb, whither he had escorted Mabel Normand to her waiting car, have shot him down. This theory, untenable if the public statements made by Peavey are correct, to the effect that he was there and knew that no one else could have entered without his knowledge, gave rise at once to the belief that information of a different nature had been wrung from the Negro when he was quizzed yesterday by Woolwine. The District Attorney, when pressed upon this point, declined to make public the substance of Peavey's statement taken before him and the detectives, but reiterated his previous assertion that it contained 'nothing new.'...
1922-02-11	This is my own story of just what happened on the night of my last visit to William D. Taylor, the evening of February 1. In response to a telephone call left by Mr. Taylor at my home during the afternoon of the day he was killed I stopped at his house between 7 and 7:15 in the evening. The purpose of my call was to pick up a book which Mr. Taylor had purchased for me that afternoon, knowing particularly that I wanted it. He had already sent one book to my home but had requested me to stop for this one, which I assumed he had purchased later. Upon my arrival I was let in by Henry Peavey, Taylor's valet, who informed me Mr. Taylor was conversing with someone over the phone. In a few moments after my arrival Mr. Taylor said good-bye to the party with whom he was conversing and left the telephone. He greeted me. He had just finished dinner and his man had cleared away the table but he asked me if I would not let him have something prepared for me or go out to dinner with him later. I declined, explaining that I was tired and that I had an early studio call to make the next morning. I said that I intended to go home early, have dinner and go to bed. For 25 minutes Mr. Taylor and I sat discussing various books and photoplays. About 20 minutes to eight, I prepared to start for home. Mr. Taylor walked with me to where my car was parked at the curbing. There was a copy of the 'Police Gazette' in the car which he noticed. He chided me for having it in my possession, remarking that Freud, Haeckel and Nietzsche were hardly compatible with such literature. After an exchange of repartee for a few minutes, I finally bade him good night and directed by chauffeur to drive me home. Before I left, Mr. Taylor promised to phone me at my home within one hour. He never did. As William (my chauffeur) pulled away from the curb I looked back and saw Mr. Taylor standing there, gazing after me. I waved my hand. That was the last time I ever saw Mr. Taylor alive. Within a few minutes I was at my home. I retired, having dinner served to me in bed about 8:15. The first knowledge I had of Mr. Taylor's death was when Edna Purviance phoned me the following morning about 7:30. She told me that Mr. Taylor's valet had been seen rushing from Mr. Taylor's home, screaming that his master was dead. I have no idea who killed Mr. Taylor or what was the reason for his death. I would only be too proud to announce the fact had I been engaged to Mr. Taylor, but such a statement would not be true. I held Mr. Taylor in highest esteem, regarding him as a very learned, cultured gentleman, with whom any woman might be proud to associate. Mr. Taylor and I had much in common and during the long period of our friendship I had made a study of the French language and philosophy in which I had been interested for some time. I am also interested in these things now. So far as revealing the contents of any letters written by Mr. Taylor to me or by me to Mr. Taylor is concerned I have no reason to fear any consequences which might result from such disclosures except the natural embarrassment of having personal correspondence revealed to the public gaze.
1922-02-11	Find Sands!' This laconic suggestion of Mrs. J. M. Berger, income tax specialist, is the solution of the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery. 'No doubt of it in my mind,' said Mrs. Berger, a young business woman, with a wealth of bronze hair, and brown eyes. 'Edward F. Sands is the man. I am sure.' Mrs. Berger opened her mail as she talked about the motion picture director who had called at her office in the H. W. Hellman building just a few hours before he was slain in his bachelor apartments. 'He was here in the afternoon to attend some business,' she explained. 'I help not only motion picture folks but many prominent business men on their income tax returns.' 'Had he expressed a fear of Sands?' Mrs. Berger was asked. 'Yes, he had talked about his former valet-secretary's forging his name, and about the 'Alias Jimmy Valentine' note that he had received. 'I did not know Mr. Taylor intimately--only in a business way, but I knew some of the most intimate details of his business which I have told to the district attorney in an effort to clear up the mystery. 'I swooned at the inquest. I am sorry I gazed at his body which was the color of his khaki suit. 'I do not think there is a woman in the case. 'Why--' her white hand pointed to a large picture of Mary Miles Minter that was hanging on the wall of her room. 'Of course little Mary loved Mr. Taylor--who didn't? We all loved him. He was one of God's gentlemen, and he was far above the average in politeness and intelligence, from what I saw of him. 'I had spent many, many hours with Mr. Taylor, but I had never heard of an enemy, except Sands. If the police find him surely, if he cannot explain his whereabouts on that night, he should be questioned carefully. 'Now, little Miss Mabel Normand is a fine girl. Of course my dealings with her have been purely business, but I think from what I have seen that Miss Normand was very worth while. Of course, Mary Miles Minter is only a child. 'Her letters, published, are purely those of a very young girl, and as Mr. Taylor said, 'a child.' 'I had asked him how she was on that day he called here and he said 'she has a touch of tonsillitis and temperament,' and that was all there was to it. 'I cannot believe a woman had anything to do with it. As to his changing his name--well, Billy Taylor may have had a reason, I do not know. If he had had an unfortunate experience in his life, perhaps he wanted to forget it. 'I only know that he was a perfect gentleman, and that I hope the police never rest until they apprehend the assassin who robbed the world of such a fine man.'
1922-02-11	A high-bred Airedale dog bounded into the Taylor mystery Saturday and started investigation along a new line which may result in locating the murderer. The dog was either given away or sold by Edward F. Sands shortly before he left the employ of Taylor. Men intimately acquainted with Sands' peculiarities say that he was very fond of this animal and that he would never have parted with it except to some one in whom he had implicit confidence. If the present owner can be found considerable light will be thrown on Sands' recent activities, it is believed. Interesting theories regarding Sands were advanced Saturday by neighbors who had observed his conduct while he was in the motion picture director's employ. One of these neighbors, a woman of high intelligence, announced she had reached the conclusion that Sands is not the guilty person. 'He appeared to me,' she said, 'to be a big healthy animal, lazy, selfish and mindful first of his personal comfort. I gain this impression not only from what I have heard, but from what I have observed of the man as he passed our home daily. Men of the type Sands apparently was do not murder --murder would mean mental discomfort and these men think first of their own well being.' This woman was greatly impressed by the theory that blackmailers had been at work. She was of the opinion that letters that had fallen into the hands of professional blackmailers may be an explanation of the mystery...
1922-02-11	...Meanwhile the police were searching for L. D. Dailey, alleged roommate of Walter Thiele at 333 East Fourth street, to question him concerning the slaying. Dailey, the police assert, is the owner of a blood- stained cap found in Thiele's room. The alleged connection of the two men with the case is being closely guarded by the police. Thiele was arrested early this morning by detectives from central police station. He is accused of committing a burglary on the night the murder occurred and is being held in the city jail on that charge. Back of it all, however, the police intimate, is the theory that the man has information in his possession which would prove of value to the probe of the mystery. He is scheduled to appear first before Capt. David L. Adams of the police detective bureau, before deputies in the sheriff's office and finally before District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine. Questioned at police headquarters early today, Thiele said that he had come to Los Angeles about three months ago from Placerville, Cal. He was planning to return to his home when he was arrested. Relative to the blood-stained cap in his possession he said that the article belonged to Dailey, a man that he described as a 'hasher out of work.' He became acquainted with the man about three weeks ago, he stated, and had offered him lodging in his own room...
1922-02-11	...Rumors that Miss Normand went to the Taylor home to force Taylor to return her letters were branded as 'vicious falsehoods' today by Charles Eyton, general manager of the Famous Players-Lasky corporation. 'These stories will be retracted or I'll know the reason why,' Eyton said. 'Miss Normand went to Taylor's home that night to get a book. She didn't try to get her letters until after the murder had been committed. I was in his home after the inquest with the public administrator when she called and asked for them. 'There is a tendency on the part of certain interests to dish dirt about a man who cannot now defend himself against scandalous insinuations. They shall retract this particular statement or I'll know the reason why.'
1922-02-11	RE-ENACTS MURDER OF FILM DIRECTOR District Atiorney Goes to Taylor's Home to Determine. Circumstances." MISS NORMAND RECALLED Actress Who was the Last to See the Movie Director Alive is Again Examined. Special to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 11 .-A dramatic re-enactment of the murder of William Desmond Taylor, film director, was staged for District Attorney Woolwine today at the scene of the slaying. Woolwine's chauffeur was placed on the floor of the Taylor home in the exact position in which the slain man was found, and the circumstances surrounding the shooting were explained to the District Attorney. The re-enactment of the murder was carried out in the greatest details. After carefully inspecting the house, outside and inside Woolwine walked to the curb to the spot to which Taylor escorted Mabel Normand to her auto a few moments before his death. The front door of the house was left open. While Woolwine stood at the curb it was pointed out to him that the slayer might have entered the house through the open door while Taylor was talking to Miss Normand. Back in the house again, Woolwine studied the probable relative positions of the slayer and his victim. From the scene of the crime Woolwine drove to the Distriet Attorney's office, where he held a conference with his chief deputy, W. C. Doran, and the five police detectives working on the case. Before entering into the conference he announced that the investigation so far showed that the slayer may have been in the house while Taylor and Miss Normand were chatting, instead of entering when Taylor and the actress went to the automobile, He said that the slayer could have hidden in the house and overheard the conversation between Taylor and Miss Normand and committed the murder when Taylor returned alone." So far in our investigation we are un against a blank wall," the District Attorney said." Before we are through, however, we hope to obtain evidence which will put us on the trail of the murderer." Interviewed Miss Minter. Woolwine confirmed reports that Mary Miles Minter had made a complete statement to Chief Deputy District Attorney Doran."Miss Minter was questioned several days ago at the start of our investigation," Woolwine said." She appeared voluntarily and did not hesitate to answer every question. She told us everything we wanted to know from her, but her statement did not supply us with any evidence of particular value," Search for a safety deposit box said to have been rented by Taylor at a downtown bank in addition to the one opened by the police soon after his murder was made today by detectives. A friend of the slain director informed the District Attorney's office that Taylor had two deposit boxes. It is believed that the second may contain letters and other data of value in the investigation. Woolwine was notified today of the arrrest in Topeka, Man., of Walter R. Underwood on a charge of embezzling $1,000 from the Pacific Electric Railroad company in Los Angeles. Underwood was reported to have told the police that he knew Taylor and Edward F. Sands, Taylor's valet and secretary, who is being sought in connection with the murder. Underwood, according to Topeka dispatches, said he had attended numerous"parties" at Taylor's home, declaring he had a"suspicion" as to who killed Taylor and indicating that he might be able to aid the police in solving the murder, but not much credence was placed in the purported statements of Underwood by the Los Angeles detectives. Persons who knew Taylor well declared they never knew a man named Underwood or a man answering the description of the man arrested at Topeka. Miss Mabel Normand tonight called at the District Attorney's office in response to, a summons and repeated her story of her last visit to Taylor's home, Says Taylor Made a Will. Frank G. Schrenkeisen, New York attorney, representing Ethel Daisy DeaneTanner, daughter of the slain man, has notified Public Administrator Bryson that Taylor informed his daughter that he had made a will. A search for this will was ordered today. Additional light on the life of Sands as been furnished by George S. Brettner, who knew the former valet well. Mr. Brettner told detectives that he believed Sands was mentally deranged, as Sands had often declared that he would commit suicide when he became 35 years old, stating that there was not much use of living after one had reached that age. He declared also that Sands usually carried a .45-calibre revolver and that he was infatuated with a girl who frequented a local dance hall and whose name has already been given the police. A search for this girl has been made for several days, as detectives believe that she might be able to throw some light on his whereabouts. Brettner gave the detectives the name of a waiter who is employed in an Alvarado Street restaurant, who is said to be a perfect double for Sands. In fact, it is said that this waiter has been mistaken for the valet many times. Evidence definitely connecting Sands with the robbery at the moving picturedirector's home last December was obtained from Sacramento. Pawn tickets for some jeweiry placed in the keeping of the Zematsky Loan and Jewelry Xompany at Sacramento were sent to Los Angeles to the local office of the concern and the tickets were turned over to the police homicide squad. Sands's handwriting was said to have been identified on the tickets and he used the name"W. Dennis Tanner." Miss Normand Issues statement. LOA ANGELES, Feb.10.

1922-02-11	Friend of Taylor, Arrested In Topeka, Blames Woman   Topeka. Kans., Feb. 10. Doubt that Walter S. Underwood, held in the Shawnee county jail here, is Edward F. Sands, wanted in connection with the murder of William Desmond Taylor, was expressed at noon today by Undersheriff O. W. Carlson, after further investigation. Underwood maintained he knew both Taylor and Sands, but declared he knew nothing of the murder. Underwood was taken off the train here on receipt of a message that he was wanted at Los Angeles on an embezzlement charge made by the Union Pacific Railway Company. The man admitted he had been employed by the company as cashier for eight months. Underwod corresponds to every mark of identification given in the description of Sands, even to slight scars on his cheeks and another on his left shoulder, according to the undersheriff. The facial scars, Un derwood asserted, were caused by mustard gas encountered in France while with the Canadian army in the war. His left arm is decorated with a tattoo mark of an anchor with the initials "W. C."   Says Woman Shot Taylor. "It was a woman who did it." Underwood said when questioned about the murder. "I know nothing about it but it was jealousy that caused it. Yes, I know Taylor. I have been at his house several times attending parties. Then he described these parties   which he declared were "wild ones" he wnien liquor and drugs were serv ed to the guests. He said he had seen both Mabel Normand and Mary Miles Minter at Taylor's house, but not at the same time. Underwood said he left Los Angeles about 10 o'clock the night of Wednesday, February 1. This was shortly after the hour fixed for the slaying of Taylor. He said he went to San Bernardino in a hired automobile. Among Underwood's effects was a receipt of a Los Angeles hotel showing he was a guest there from January 18 until January 30. There was also a pawn ticket for a revolver issued in Los Angeles dated January 30. Underwood's railroad ticket showed he left San Bernardino last Sunday night.

1922-02-12	(Los Angeles)--A group of investigators tonight went to dig up the cellar in the Taylor home. They had been told by an anonymous informant that something of great value was hidden in the cellar; something not money, but which would show a connection between certain persons and the slaying. They went out armed with picks and shovels and spades, only to find there was no cellar.

1922-02-12	Henry Peavey, colored valet for Mr. Taylor. was summarily called to Dist.-Atty. Woolwine's office late yesterday following the discovery of new and important information regarding the murder. Peavey had previously been questioned at considerable length in Mr. Woolwine's office by Chief Deputy Doran. The valet arrived at Mr. Woolwine's office shortly after 3 p.m. yesterday and was closeted for a considerable time with the District Attorney, Mr. Doran and officers of the police department and of the Sheriff's force. The instructions for the officers to bring Peavey to the office where the investigation into the murder mystery has been centralized came shortly after a new witness had been in long conference with the officials. This witness whose name was said by Undersheriff Biscailus and Deputy Sheriff Nolan to be Henry Britt, but which was signed by the young man as Edward F. Arto, was taken to Mr. Woolwine's office from Sheriff Traeger's headquarters. He refused to give his name to newspaper men. Mr. Arto, as he signed himself. said he over heard a conversation either the night of the murder or the night before between Peavey and another man regarding Mr. Taylor's affairs. The nature of the conversation aside from that Mr. Arto declined to divulge, but he believed the information of value to the investigators. Mr. Arto was going to the home of some relatives near the Taylor apartments on South Alvarado street about 7:10 p.m. when he heard the two men talking. He gave a rather vague description of the strange man but said he was an American apparently, wore a cap and aroused Mr. Arto's suspicion. PEAVEY STRENUOUSLY DENIED THAT HE HELD ANY SUCH CONVERSATION.
1922-02-12	[regarding the night of the murder] Mrs. M. S. Stone, mother-in-law of A. W. Wachter, of 412-A South Alvarado Street, gave one of the most interesting recitals that has yet come to the attention of officers. She said: 'I was walking slowly up Alvarado Street, going to the home of Mr. Wachter for dinner.' Mrs. Stone lives at the Duke Apartments on South Carondelet Street, and frequently goes to the Wachter home for dinner, generally walking north on Alvarado Street from Westlake Park to the latter home. 'As I crossed from the west to the east side of Alvarado Street, at Sixth, I saw a man standing on the corner, apparently waiting for a car. But he didn't board the car that came along, and as I was rather nervous about walking up the street in the dusk, I waited momentarily on the corner.' The man stopped in front of the Hotel Alvarado, according to Mrs. Stone, and transferred something from his left hip pocket to the right hand pocket of his coat. 'Then he started rather aimlessly up the hill, on Alvarado Street,' Mrs. Stone continued. 'I walked on behind him, and when he reached Maryland Street he turned north [sic] out of Alvarado.' Maryland Street is the one that runs directly behind the apartment occupied by Taylor. Mrs. Stone said that when she noticed the man at first she said to herself that he would have been well dressed except for the fact that his suit did not appear to fit well at the collar--that it bulged uncertainly in the rear, and that his collar was not visible. 'At that time,' Mrs. Stone said, speaking of the man's turning into Maryland Street, 'I thought it might have been Taylor's chef.' She knew Edward F. Sands, Taylor's former valet and chauffeur [sic], as his chef, having seen him in the court at various times wearing the white cap common to cooks.
1922-02-12	Douglas MacLean, of 406-B South Alvarado, told one of the most interesting stories of all. Mrs. MacLean was the one who saw the mystery man leaving the Taylor home just after the shot was fired. Her description of the man has been given time and again, and both say that they have been bothered greatly by detectives and newspaper men, repeating over and over the same story. 'Mrs. MacLean and I had just finished dinner,' Mr. MacLean said. 'The night being rather chilly, I had gone upstairs to the bathroom, to get a small electric stove we have there, and bring it downstairs. 'I heard a report like a shot, but thought it merely an automobile backfiring. 'Mrs. MacLean also heard it. She went to the door and glanced around. She saw the man on Taylor's porch. He was standing with the screen door in his hand, apparently looking about. He then turned back to the door as if speaking farewell, and after doing so left the porch, walking down the walk toward Alvarado street. [sic] No, he didn't run, nor did he seem hurried.' Mrs. MacLean said she did not see the man's face. In fact, it's rather hard to distinguish anyone at that distance in the court, because of the peculiar lighting system. And Mr. MacLean, to demonstrate this fact to the detectives, went from his house to the porch of the Taylor home and posed in the same manner as the man whom his wife had seen. 'Mrs. MacLean thought nothing of the incident,' he concluded, 'and we started playing dominoes together, doing so for some time, before retiring.'
1922-02-12	It rather lends interest to an interview to be obliged to pick your victim in the corridor of a crowded hotel like the Biltmore. Having felt that an interview with May McAvoy was strictly due before her vacation terminated, we arrived a little ahead of the appointed time and waited to find the face so familiar to us on the screen. A blue-eyes sub-deb paused uncertainly and sat on our divan, profile view, there was a resemblance. 'Are you Miss McAvoy?' we inquired. The girl beamed; 'no,' said she, 'but thanks for the compliment. I think she is just the sweetest thing, and if you expect her I shan't move till she comes and I get a good look at her.' Shortly after we spotted a tiny person in a big fur coat and after making a careful close-up found that we were correct. The orchestra struck up Chopin's Military Polonaise' and the small person indicated that she did not like music with her interviews, so we betook ourselves to the quiet grill, much to the disappointment of the sub- deb. There we decided that May McAvoy might be Julia Sanderson's little sister and were told that every one else had said the same thing. There is no use asking a New York girl how she likes her home town and we knew from the Motion Picture Directory that May McAvoy was born here; we knew the date, too, and it was ridiculously short time ago. We also knew that she is four feet eleven inches in height and weighs ninety-four pounds. Then there is a long list of the pictures she has appeared in, although she did not start in early childhood. 'I went to school with Genevieve and Vivan Tobin. We were all stage- struck. After they went on the stage I decided to try pictures, and I was lucky enough to get a part after I had been atmosphere in three. These small parts were followed by a couple of more important ones and then I co-starred for Mr. Blackton. 'With all the lovely parts I have had, Grizel is my favorite. Since then I have played 'kids' and ingenues, but there was so much to Grizel. Working with Mr. and Mrs. Robertson also made 'Sentimental Tommy' a picture to remember.' We asked her if she would like to do 'Peter Pan,' to which she replied that she thought Peter should be a boy, but that she would love to do Wendy. This seemed to us a wise choice, for May McAvoy is one of the most feminine little people we have ever met. There is something about her that is intensely serious when she talks of her work, and it is astonishing to learn that any one so fragile could stand the grind of making seven pictures in ten months. 'One of the best directors I ever had was poor Mr. Taylor, who directed me just a short time ago. I cannot understand this awful tragedy.' 'You certainly must have needed this vacation,' we ventured. 'Yes; it was nice to see New York again. Nothing is changed much. I have been to the dentist, bought some clothes and danced a little, that is all, but the time has flown and I shall be on my way back by next Sunday.' 'And your next picture?' 'It may be 'Blood and Sand' with Bebe Daniels and Rodolph Valentino, in which I shall be the simple Spanish wife. 'I love California, especially when one is working as hard as I have this past year. Only about a week of rest between pictures, and then I get in a little golf. Most of the clothes I have added in New York are sport things. We don't go in for formal evening gowns much and the parts I get seldom demand them, either. I am never grown up enough. 'Up in New Hampshire where I went for an exhibitors' convention, I had my first sleigh ride. I also made my first speech, and it has settled my mind forever upon the subject of personal appearances. I nearly died of nerves. Never again. 'I would really rather go back to work than do anything I know of, and I much prefer being in California.' On the whole May McAovy seems to be a girl who appreciates her blessing. She has had wonderful success owing to the rare quality of her work on the screen, and she likes it all.
1922-02-12	...Miss Edna Purviance, film actress who lives at 402 A South Alvarado, in the house next to the one occupied by Taylor, said: 'I was not at home the night of the murder, so of course I did not hear or see anything unusual.' She explained that she and her mother had been away from home until about 11:45 o'clock. 'Reports in the newspapers that I tried the door and rang the bell of Mr. Taylor's home, when I noticed lights burning there, are false,' Miss Purviance said. 'There is nothing unusual to me in the sight of lights burning in a private home at midnight, and I certainly did not try to enter the house that night.'
1922-02-12	Los Angeles, Feb. 11--Miss Gene Ross, silhouette artist, who lives in the Ambassador hotel, gave this afternoon a word silhouette of William D. Taylor. She had regarded him she said, as a man of drab personality, a camouflage man who fitted into the background, whose clothes were somber, dull, colorless, whose conversation was quiet, vague and submerged. But on the Saturday night before his death, she says, she noted a change in the man. He had come to her studio in the Ambassador hotel with Miss Claire Windsor. And while Miss Windsor was looking over the studies in black an white, Taylor paced the floor, nervous, fear in his manner, his walk, the tension of his hands. She knew he was afraid of something, she said. He paid no attention to either herself or his companion, yet he seemed to wince and stare when persons passed by the door.
1922-02-12	While members of the local police and detective departments were running down every available clew in the probe into the mystery murder of William D. Taylor, noted film director, two representatives of a nationally known detective agency recently assigned to the case were engaged in a thorough quiz of every person living in the court in which the director formerly lived. And Mrs. M. S. Stone, mother-in-law of A. W. Wachter, of 412-A South Alvarado street, gave one of the most interesting recitals that has yet come to the attention of officers. She said: 'I was walking slowly up Alvarado street, going to the home of Mr. Wachter for dinner.' Mrs. Stone lives at the Duke Apartments on South Carondelet street, and frequently goes to the Wachter home for dinner, generally walking north on Alvarado street from Westlake Park to the latter home. 'As I crossed from the west to the east side of Alvarado street, at Sixth, I saw a man standing on the corner, apparently waiting for a car. But he didn't board the car that came along, and as I was rather nervous about walking up the street in the dusk, I waited momentarily on the corner.' The man stopped in front of the Hotel Alvarado, according to Mrs. Stone, and transferred something from his left hip pocket to the right hand pocket of his coat. 'Then he started rather aimlessly up the hill, on Alvarado street,' Mrs. Stone continued. 'I walked on behind him, and when he reached Maryland street he turned north out of Alvarado.' Maryland street is the one that runs directly behind the apartments occupied by Taylor. Mrs. Stone said that when she noticed the man at first she said to herself that he would have been well dressed except for the fact that his suit did not appear to fit well at the collar--that it bulged uncertainly in the rear, and that his collar was not visible. 'At that time,' Mrs. Stone said, speaking of the man's turning into Maryland street, 'I thought it might have been Taylor's chef.' She knew Edward F. Sands, Taylor's former valet and chauffeur, as his chef, having seen him in the court at various times wearing the white cap common to cooks. But this man was taller. She described the man she had seen as being 5 feet 9 inches in height, wearing a dark suit, tan oxfords and dark socks. Also, she said, his hair was dark, that his neck and earl lobes were thick and his skin ruddy. She said he wore a cap, although she could not distinguish whether it was plaid or checked. But she did not get a good look at his face when she first encountered him. Later in the evening, after Mr. and Mrs. Wachter had left the house, she took little Lynette Wachter, her granddaughter to bed. Just as they were mounting the stairs, about 8 o'clock, she though she heard a pistol shot, but fearing to frighten her charge, she did not mention it. But after arriving upstairs, she went to the window and looked out. 'I had a strange feeling,' Mrs. Stone said, 'and thought at the time that I was glad my daughter lived on the south side of the court, because of the shrubbery on the north side. Mrs. Stone said that Mr. and Mrs. Wachter had returned home about 11:30 o'clock in the evening. N. J. Harrington, of 408-A South Alvarado, threw further light on the case, and also added to its mystery. Last August, he said, he was returning home after dark one night. After putting his car in the garage, he passed the house occupied by Taylor and saw a man peering into one of the windows which was not fully curtained. 'He was about 5 feet 9 inches in height,' Mr. Harrington said, 'about 30 years of age, and weighed about 160 pounds. He had regular features and was dressed in a gray suit and cap. No, it was not Sands. I had seen him too often in the court to mistake him.' And on the Monday preceding the murder-- When Harrington again walked by the Taylor home, he saw two men at Taylor's front door. They apparently had rung the bell and when no one answered, they were talking between themselves on the veranda. One was much smaller than the other, and one wore a cap, the other a hat. Mr. and Mrs. W. B. Lawrence of 400-A South Alvarado also told an interesting story. The family was downstairs on the evening of the murder until about 8:30 o'clock, when Mrs. Lawrence went to the bedroom upstairs. 'My husband said he heard a short conversation--portions of it--a woman's laugh, a man say good-by, and then a car driving away,' Mrs. Lawrence said. Their apartment is the nearest in the court to Alvarado street. 'That is all we know.' But about a week before Taylor's murder, Mrs. Lawrence said she went home alone one night, before 7 o'clock, and saw two men loitering behind their home. And several days previous to Taylor's death, a man came to the Lawrence home inquiring for Taylor. 'He looked enough like Taylor to have been his twin,' Mr. Lawrence said. Miss Edna Purviance, film actress, who lives at 402-A South Alvarado, in the house next to the one occupied by Taylor, said: 'I was not at home the night of the murder, so of course I did not hear or see anything unusual.' She explained that she and her mother had been away from home until about 11:45 o'clock. 'Reports in the newspapers that I tried the door and rang the bell at Mr. Taylor's home, when I noticed lights burning there, are false,' Miss Purviance said. 'There is nothing unusual to me in the sight of lights burning in a private home at midnight, and I certainly did not try to enter the house that night.' E. C. Jessurun of 406-A South Alvarado, and owner of the court, admitted that he had heard the shot which it is believed ended Taylor's life. 'I had been ill for about three weeks,' he said. 'My wife and I were talking and reading when I heard the report. 'I sat up, hearing the noise, but figured it was only an automobile back- fire, so lay down again.' Vern Dumas of 408-A South Alvarado said that he noticed one of the window curtains in Taylor's home slightly awry when he came home the night of the murder. He walks home directly by the Taylor house, through an areaway, after putting his car in the garage. 'But I didn't notice particularly,' he said: 'It looked as if a table had been pushed against it.' Both Dumas and H. H. Lewin commented on the preciseness with which Taylor's body was arranged on the floor. 'It looked as if he had been laid out in a coffin for burial,' both said. Then came an interview with A. W. Wachter of 412-A South Alvarado. He said that on Thursday night, more than a week after Taylor's murder, a Marmon coupe had driven up in front of the entrance to the court. Wachter is in the automobile business, and says he can tell the make of a car by the hum of its engine. 'The engine remained running,' Wachter said, 'but the lights were turned out. A man ran to the door of Taylor's home and rang the bell, but when no one responded, he ran back to the car, jumped in, the lights were flashed on, and the car sped away.' Wachter said that the night before the murder he had seen Mabel Normand and Taylor get in a coupe and drive away. On the night of the murder, he said, he was away from home from before 8 o'clock until about 11:15 or 11:30, but that about 4 a.m. on February 2 he had risen and looked out the window, noticing the lights burning in Taylor's home. C. A. Fitzhenry, a friend of Wachter, who visited him frequently, told Wachter that on several occasions, upon leaving the court, he had seen a man in a black overcoat and black Fedora hat standing at the corner of Maryland and Alvarado streets. Mr. and Mrs. S. G. Buckner of 412-B South Alvarado street, also told an interesting story. They were at a dancing party on the fateful Wednesday night, they said, and did not return home until about 4:30 o'clock Thursday morning. 'We noticed the lights then,' both said, 'burning in Taylor's home.' They thought nothing of it, however, but when Mr. Buckner arose at 6 o'clock to investigate trouble with their hot-water heater the lights were still burning. 'I thought it strange at the time,' he said. Later they were awakened by the screams of Henry Peavey, Taylor's negro servant. 'He was running about the lawn and walks, screaming that Mr. Taylor was murdered,' Mrs. Buckner said. Mr. Buckner hurried over to the house, being one of the first to arrive there. He also was the man who notified the police of Taylor's death. 'I noticed and commented on the fact that the body was laid out precisely,' Mr. Buckner said. 'The cuffs and collar were straight and his clothing not disarranged at all. I thought it strange at the time that a man murdered should fall in such a position.' Mr. Buckner noticed that Taylor's wrist watch, just visible below the cuff at his left wrist, showed the hour as being just 8 o'clock when he saw it. He said he thought the watch was still running. And Douglas MacLean, of 406-B South Alvarado, told one of the most interesting stories of all. Mrs. MacLean was the one who saw the mystery man leaving the Taylor house just after the shot was fired. Her description of the man has been given time and again, and both say that they have been bothered greatly by detectives and newspaper men, repeating over and over the same story. 'Mrs. MacLean and I had just finished dinner,' Mr. MacLean said. 'The night being rather chilly, I had gone upstairs to the bathroom, to get a small electric stove we have there, and bring it downstairs. 'I heard a report like a shot, but thought it merely an automobile backfiring. 'Mrs. MacLean also heard it. She went to the door and glanced around. She saw the man on Taylor's porch. He was standing with the screen door in his hand, apparently looking about.

'Mrs. MacLean thought nothing of the incident,' he concluded, 'and we started playing dominoes together, doing so for some time before retiring.'
1922-02-12	A man suspected by at least six police investigators of having first- hand knowledge of the slaying of William Desmond Taylor, internationally known film director, has been identified by the detectives working on the case and by some of the witnesses questioned by Dist.-Atty. Woolwine in the past few days, and his arrest is believed to be a matter of hours. This was indicated by Captain of Detectives Adams when he admitted that several places where the suspect is expected to appear were guarded by his officers yesterday. The man's name is known to The Times, but is withheld at the request of the authorities. A belief that the suspect may be the man who killed Taylor was strengthened yesterday following an all-night investigation of facts uncovered Friday. The man, the officers now believe, is the owner of the blood-stained cap found by the police and has been in hiding since the night of the murder. His actions have been traced sufficiently to convince a number of the investigators that he was either implicated in the slaying of Taylor or is withholding some important information. His home in an apartment-house on West Fourth Street was searched by the officers armed with a search warrant early yesterday morning. Later the search for the man shifted to a downtown location and out of town. 'The man is in town, we are certain of this,' one of the detectives on the case said early yesterday morning. 'We know all about his actions, and as soon as we can lay our hands on him we will place him under arrest on the charge of murdering William D. Taylor.' That the officers are on the right track was indicated by the fact that the cap found by the police was taken to the District Attorney's office and there exhibited to Miss Mabel Normand and William Davis, her chauffeur, shortly before midnight Friday. Immediately after the reported identification of the cap the officers left the District Attorney's office with orders to arrest the suspects. The arrest of Walter Thiele by Detectives Lloyd and Roberts on the charge of suspicion of burglary had only a remote connection with the investigation concerning the suspect. The officers admit that Thiele may be able to give them some information about the man, but stated emphatically that Thiele had no knowledge of the crime or anything directly connected with it. Henry Peavey, colored valet for Mr. Taylor, was summarily called to Dist.-Atty. Woolwine's office late yesterday following the discovery of new and important information regarding the murder. Peavey had previously been questioned at considerable length in Mr. Woolwine's office by Chief Deputy Doran. The valet arrived at Mr. Woolwine's office shortly after 8 p.m. yesterday and was closeted for a considerable time with the District Attorney, Mr. Doran and officers of the police department and of the Sheriff's force. The instructions for the officers to bring Peavey to the office where the investigation into the murder mystery has been centralized came shortly after a new witness had been in long conference with the officials. The witness, whose name was said by Undersheriff Biscailuz and Deputy Sheriff Nolan to be Henry Britt, but which was signed by the young man as Edward F. Arto, was taken to Mr. Woolwine's office from Sheriff Traeger's headquarters. He refused to give his name to newspaper men. Mr. Arto, as he signed himself, said he overheard a conversation either the night of the murder or the night before between Peavey and another man regarding Mr. Taylor's affairs. The nature of the conversation aside from that Mr. Arto declined to divulge, but he believed the information of value to the investigators. Mr. Arto was going to the home of some relatives near the Taylor apartments on South Alvarado street about 7:10 p.m. when he heard the two men talking. He gave a rather vague description of the strange man but said he was an American apparently, wore a cap and aroused Mr. Arto's sus[....(gap)] stated. Peavey strenuously denied that he held any such conversation. The Taylor home faces south into an apartment court and the rear of the building is flush with the sidewalk on Maryland street. It was at this point that the conversation took place, the witness stated...
1922-02-12	The Whitney family have the greatest respect for Miss Mary Miles Minter, we are good friends, but we know of nothing that would throw light on the killing of William Desmond Taylor, who was Miss Minter's director in Santa Barbara,' said H. R. Whitney, whose wife, Charlotte Whitney, was Miss Minter's secretary. Efforts to see Mrs. Whitney failed, because she was with friends, and the family said would not be back tonight, that they did not know where she had gone. The talk developed that a member of the Los Angeles Sheriff's office was here two days ago and had a long talk with Charlotte Whitney in connection with the associations between Mr. Taylor and Miss Minter, but 'he could get nothing of importance, because Mrs. Whitney knew nothing,' the husband said.
1922-02-12	WATCHING TO SEIZE TAYLOR SUSPECT Loss Angeles Detectives Awalt Return of Man Who, They Assert, Did Killing." CLUE IN A STAINED HAT Anonymous Letter Sets Police to Seeking Something Buried Under Taylor House. Special to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 11.While four detectives were guarding a house in West Fourth Street tonight, awaiting the appearance of a man who, it is said, will be charged with the murder of William Desmond Taylor, Captain D. L. Adams and Deputy Sheriff Harvey Bell rushed out on a mysterious new clew, while a group of investigators went to dig up the cellar in the Taylor home. They had been told by an anonymous informant that the crime was committed at 10:15 o'clock at night and that something of great value was hidden in the cellar. This something was not money, but would show a connection between certain persons and the crime, They went out, armed with picks, shovels and spades, only to find there was no cellar. There was, however, at the side of the house an opening in the wall. A board was removed from the opening, when there was found room for a small-seized man to crawl a little way under the house. The only thing discovered up to a late hour was a gas meter. The police are withholding the name of the man sought in Fourth Street until after he is taken. They asserted, however, that they have traced his movements for more than a week and have evidence that he knows about the murder. They say too, that he is the owner of the bloodstained cap taken last night from Walter Thiele, who was arrested last night on suspicion but later cleared. Jealousy Clew Sought. LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. II. Henry Peavey, who was the houseman for William Desmond Taylor, murdered film Director, was escorted late today to the office of District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine by two Deputy Sheriffs. The deputies, Peavey, Mr. Woolwine, W C. Doran, his chief deputy, and a court reporter were all secluded for several hours in Mr. Woolwine's private office. A half hour after the conference began Captain David L. Adams of the Los Angeles Police Department, who has had charge of the police investigation, joined the other officials and Peavey. This was the first time that representatives of the three principal offices working on the case that is, the police, the Sheriff and the District Attorney had met in a joint conference. Peavey has made several statements, including a very extended one taken by the police. All of his stories have had to do with the life of Mr. Taylor in the months that Peavey was employed by him and with occurrences surrounding the finding of Taylor's body. The taking of a new statement under the circumstances existing today was deemed to mean that further investigation of the Sheriff's theory of jealousy as a possible motive for the crime was to be made by all the officers employed on the case. Other than the examination of Peavey, apparently little of importance happened today in the murder inquiry. Peavey left the office after having been closeted with the officiais about an hour. He went out alone, the officials continuing their conference when he departed. "I have nothing to say," Peavey told reporters. "I've just told my story over again to Mr. Woolwine.” Under Sheriff Biscailluse and Captain  Adams came out a little later. "I cannot say that anything new has developed from the questioning of Peavey," Biscailluse said. "However, that does not mean that no new angle of investigation has been discovered." We will have to check up on certain matters before we can determine that." Taylor's Publicity Man Calls. Ted Taylor, former publicity man for the slain director, accompanied by his wife, called at the District Attorney's office late in the afternoon and asked for a conference. They said they wished to discuss certain theories they had about the tragedy. Mr. Woolwine talked with them for a few minutes, then left them closeted with a detective. The District Attorney said that every one he had questioned about the case told a straightforward story without hesitancy or the slightest indication of an attempt to conceal anything." Mr. Woolwine mentioned by name Mary Miles Minter, film actress, well acquainted with the slain director, saying her story had been " frank and straightforward." Mr. Woolwine said some "vague surmises" concerning the case, but "no real theories," had been advanced by some of those he questioned. "Practically every one has mentioned the name of Edward F. Sands, Taylor's former Secretary, who is missing," the District Attorney said." We still believe it is a matter of great importance to get in touch with that man. Letters written by Miss Normand to Taylor and found in a room in his house remained in possession of Mr. Woolwine today, but he failed to attach any "significance" to them. "They certainly will not be published without Miss Normand's consent," the District Attorney said in reply to a question by a reporter. He added that Miss Normand had not given such consent. Youth is Cleared of Connection. Walter Thiele, 25 years of age, who said he was born in Oakland and has been in Los Angeles for a year, was taken into custody shortly before midnight last night and booked at the city jail on charges of carrying a concealed weapon and suspicion of burglary. During the examination of Mabel Normand by District Attorney Woolwine four police detectives took into the conference a cap reported to have been worn by Thiele at the time of his arrest indicating a possible connection with the Taylor case, but David Adams, captain of detectives, announced later that the police investigation of Thiele convinced him that Thiele had no connection with nor could he furnish any information concerning the Taylor case. A bloodstained cap found in Thiele' s room, the captain said, has no bearing on the Taylor investigation. "Considerable work has been done outside of the examination of witnesses in my office," Woolwine said today, and this examination is really but a small part of the investigation. Results thus far are that the investigation has been entirely devold of workable clues. Scores of angles have been investigated, but we have not been able to get a toehold in the case leading to the solution." Thirty members of the independent Soreen Artists' Guild issued a statement here today asking fair play from the public in its consideration of conditions in the motion picture industry and especially in the lives of the motion picture people. The statement follows: "We do not ask for particular favors but only for the American principle upon which this democracy was founded one of fair play. "The recent upsavory publicity that has followed the wake of the demise of the late William Taylor has resulted in our industry being maligned, mere rumor accepted as fact and idle gossip magnified into reality. "Billy Taylor needs no eulogy. The life he led was but an indication of the true character of the man who was struck down by an assassin's bullet. "The police have given as a theory that revenge accentuated the crime that resulted in William Taylor's death, exonerating the motion picture industry or any of its persons as being implicated. Deny Allegations of Vice. "We are not rampant with vice, "The American public did not attack all Governors because a charge was filed against a certain State Executive. "The American public did not attack all Ministers because a wanton crime was charged to a preacher of the gospel. "All we ask is that the public bear with this industry and not accept rumors as fact. "We are just normal human beings. We are not ethereal, and do not want to be regarded as such. "Our happy marriages far exceed those of divores. Our church-going populace is equal to that of any other profession. "We are law abiding citizens, and we rear families, and yet William Taylor's death has resulted in aspersions being cast upon this industry and upon us. We are striving to make the world a better place to live in through the screen. And we, who have accepted that responsibility placed upon us by the public through their patronage, feel it is a personal affront for them to assume through innuendo that we are not worthy of that honour. "We have striven hard, and we believe succeeded in giving joy to millions. In return it is only fair that we expect support, at least until rumor is substantiated by fact. "We deny that motion picture people are as pictured. We deny that the industry is rampant with crime and vice. We deny that motion picture people are sinners, and we only quote the Bible to those who malign us: 'Let he without sin cast the stone.' "We are a part of every American home, not through any selfish desire, but because it is the will of the public. The public has virtually accepted us as a member of each family. Yet they do not, we believe, accord us the same treatment that they would others of their household. "The American idea of fair play certainly we are not asking too much in expecting that."

Mr. Williams said that Mr. Hays shared his views that Los Angeles would continue to be the centre of the industry. FRESNO, Cal., Feb, 11. The man believed to be Edward F. Sands, wanted in Los Angeles in connection with the murder of William Desmond Taylor, who was reported living in a shack on the banks of the San Joaquin River, proved today to be a prospector named Sanborn, who had been living in the shack for months.
1922-02-12	SAN FRANCSCO YOUTH SAYS HE'S TAYLOR'S SON He Contends Slain Film Director Mother in Kansas. Is Man Who Deserted His. Special to The Neat York Times. SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Feb. 11.Possibility that William Desmond Taylor was twice married and that a son is living in San Francisco developed here today, and the authorities here say that Ethel Daisy Deane-Tanner's claims to Taylor's estate will be contested by the San Francisco claimant. William Edward Taylor of 1,966 Twenty-second Street says he is confident the victim of the mysterious slaying in Hollywood was his father. He will go to Los Angeles Tuesday with a San Francisco detective to place his proofs before the Public Administrator there and to tell his story to District Attorney Woolwine. According to the story made public here tonight, Taylor married Olive Randall at Wallace, Kans,, in 1890. Later they moved to Laramie, Wyo., where a son was born. Subsequently Taylor deserted his wife and child. Mrs. Taylor died in Cheyenne, Wyo. in 1902. Young William Edward Taylor, so the story runs, was taken by his grandfather, John Randall, to a farm near Lindsborg, Kans., where he lived with his grandparents and attended school. In 1905, while still a boy, he came to California and worked for a time for "Lucky" Baldwin, breaking colts near Los Angeles. He came to San Francisco in 1906 and has lived here and at Larkspur, in Marin County, ever since. "The motion picture director killed in Los Angeles was my father," Taylor said today. "As to whether or not I shall be able to prove it remains to be seen. The reasons upon which I base my belief may not appeal to the authorities, but at least I can tell my story and let them investigate it. "The thought of any possible connection between a motion picture director killed in Los Angeles, and myself never once occurred to me until I saw William Desmond Taylor's picture in the paper. Even though I have no recollection of ever having seen my father, there was nothing strange about recogniging his picture. For years, ever since I was a little shaver on the farm back in Kansas, I had carried a picture of him. The pose was identical it was the same man. ""in 1910 my grandfather died and I went back to Lindsborg to claim my mother's share in his estate. The administrator, Frantz Jojnson, said I would have to prove who my father was. It was at that time I made my first serious attempt to discover his identity and whereabouts. I went to Cripple Creek, where I talked with Mrs. Sarah Leighton, who had known both my father and my mother. I also talked with Alice Darling. "In Cheyenne I talked with Bote Darling, at that time Superintendent of the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph company, who had known my parents when I was born. I taiked with many persons who had known my father when I was a baby, but none of them could tell me what had become of of him. The editor of The Cheyenne Herald, I think it was, told me my father had gone to the Klondike. "From the investigation I then made and from things told me by my grandfather, I learned my father had been born in Ireland and educated in England. He was pictured as a brilliant man, but one somewhat given to drinking. He was interested in theatricals or in a show of some sort. My grandfather, who hated him, often told me my mother had run away from home shortly before she married Taylor and that she wanted to be, or did become, an actress. Even now I have a faint recollection of the wonderful costumes she wore. I finally satisfied the administrator of my grandfather's estate as to my parentage, received my share of the property and came back to San Francisco, or rather to Larkspur. I have lived in San Francisco for the last two years. I am convinced from what has been told me of my father that he and the Los Angeles director were one and the same man. The people who told me these things still are living back in Kansas, Colorado and Wyoming, and it ought not to be difficult to determine the truth of the matter. Anyhow, I am going to Los Angeles Tuesday to tell the authorities what I know and what I suspect." The San Francisco claimant to the Taylor estate undeniably bears a strong resemblance to the slain film director. The fact is freely commented on by authorities here. The lines of his face are more rugged, but the likeness is unmistakable. He looks to be about 30 years old. He is married and has four children. He is employed by a local fruit concern and has a good reputation.   
1922-02-13	Beg Pardon Ruth Wing Taylor today asked that newspapers retract the 'psychic' explanation of the slaying of William Desmond Taylor, in which she was quoted as receiving a 'key' to the solution from occult students. THE RECORD wishes to explain to its readers that the story came from indirect sources, and sincerely regrets its publication.
1922-02-13	(letter to the editor) No one takes pleasure in accusing a dead man, who cannot defend himself before earthly accusers; nevertheless, lovers of decency fail to understand why anyone should want to defend William D. Taylor, the latest murder victim, and describe him as an 'hitherto highly respected citizen.' Enough has come to light to prove that if he enjoyed the respect of decent people, he was not worthy of it. Some may not be certain whether this is a case of a good man gone bad or a bad man found out. Usually character and habits are fully formed before middle age and it is not likely that this man Taylor was an exception. If he had always lived a clean, respectable life he would hardly have become the moral degenerate that his actions and mode of life, as now revealed, indicate. Since it has become known that in their social life many of the leading stars are flagrant violators of the laws of God and man, living in vice and debauchery, it is time that respectable people should turn their backs upon them and protect themselves from pollution. All citizens should obey the laws, including the 18th Amendment, and when they refuse to do so, let them be punished.
1922-02-13	One of the most startling bits of information turned over to the investigators was the reported statement of Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored servant, that he expected to see his employer killed. This statement was made, it is said, the day following the robbery of Taylor's home by Sands. Shortly after the last robbery of the slain director's home Peavey is said to have told Harold Freeman, a milkman who delivered milk to the Taylor home, that he expected to find Taylor dead on the morning after the robbery was committed and would not be surprised if he himself were not later killed. ...Another development of importance concerned information about a woman whom Edward F. Sands, former valet-secretary to Taylor, is alleged to have visited frequently. ...Freeman, who says he met Sands every morning for several months, also declared that he saw the fugitive ex-servant shortly after Christmas in front of a downtown theater. Freeman states that he and his wife were standing in front of the showhouse early in the evening when Sands passed. Freeman further declared, it is said, that Sands asserted that he had 'something on Taylor.' On several occasions when Freeman remarked how well Taylor treated his employee, Sands is said to have replied: 'Well, he has to treat me right, for I certainly have the goods on him.'
1922-02-13	...Unavailing search was made Monday for a scenario writer and his wife, wanted in connection with the Taylor murder... Search of the studios failed to reveal the whereabouts of a scenarist, a writer of 'gags' for movie comedies. This man, formerly a well-known song writer, is sought, together with his wife, because they are believed to know the whereabouts of a certain dope peddler who may be able to explain the slaying... The husband and wife, who are both scenario writers, are known to most of the prominent figures in the Los Angeles movie colony. Nobody, however, was able to tell where they now live. At the house where the couple was formerly made their home it was said their present address was unknown. The husband is a writer of 'gags,' as the funny situations in slapstick comedies are called. He has worked for nearly all of the leading film comedians, including Charlie Chaplin and 'Fatty' Arbuckle. Deputy Sheriff Frank Dewar, who dug up the clue involving the dope ring, was systematically combing the studios Monday in search of someone who might tell him where the scenarists might be found.
1922-02-13	The angle on which Deputy Sheriff Dewar is working is considered one of the most important since the probe was opened. The former song writer and scenarist, whose name is known to the Express, but is withheld at the request of the sheriff's office, is alleged to have been active in the operations of the narcotic ring in question, and is asserted to have certain knowledge in his possession which would prove of material value to the investigation. This man is known to have been extremely friendly with a well known actress whose name has already been mentioned in connection with the case. Dewar expected today to interview the song writer, if his alleged hiding place was located. An arrest may follow, it is said.
1922-02-13	(Los Angeles)...The search for the couple was actuated by a belief that they could give information concerning a gang of 'dope' peddlers who, it was suspected, may have plotted against the murdered director... 'The scenarist whom we have been watching was formerly a song writer in New York,' Deputy Sheriff Dewar said further. 'Some time ago he went to Hollywood where he obtained work as a writer of humorous movie sketches. We believe he knows more about the sale of 'dope' to narcotic fiends than possibly anyone outside of the peddlers themselves.'
1922-02-13	...Mrs. Robins, who married William Cunningham Deane-Tanner, or William Desmond Taylor, as he was later known, in 1902, said her former husband had spent some time on a pony ranch in southwestern Kansas before she met him in New York. The only information she had ever had was that which Deane-Tanner gave her personally. 'Mr. Deane-Tanner told me that when he arrived here from Ireland he had gone out to this ranch,' Mrs. Robins said, 'and his family in Ireland had bought for him a part interest in it. When I met him he referred to it and told me a flaw in the title had forced several of the shareholders, including himself, to give up their part, and he then joined the Davenport road company. After the failure of his venture in Kansas he returned to his home in Ireland for a visit. 'With reference to the claim of this Mr. Taylor in California that he is the son of the murdered director, I would not like to say flatly that the claim is or is not true, for I knew little of Mr. Deane-Tanner's life on the ranch in Kansas and did not find it necessary to catechize him minutely, and he never mentioned anything to me about having been married out there. Perhaps there is some truth in the story, or it may be another of the many persons who come forward whenever there is an estate to be settled. I have been interested in the number of persons who claim Mr. Deane-Tanner, or Taylor, was their father. To date he must have had at least six or seven children besides my own daughter, if the stories are all correct. As Mr. Deane-Tanner would only be about fifty years old now, that is rather ridiculous, I think.' Referring to the criminal end of the case, Mrs. Robins criticized the work of the Los Angeles detectives and prosecutors, saying they do not seem to be particularly anxious to solve the mystery of the identity of the murderer. 'I have bitterly resented the accounts printed in some of the newspapers here that my daughter and myself are merely interested in the financial part of the affair and are more interested in the Taylor estate than in the identity of the person who killed my former husband. This is absolutely untrue, for, as Mr. Taylor's former wife, I am deeply grieved at this terrible affair and am anxious to see the guilty person punished.' Returning to the discussion of the claim of the man who says the movie director was his father, Mrs. Robins said that it seemed improbable that her first husband ever used the name of Taylor before he left New York in 1908. She said that to old friends who knew him when he first came to this country and had been in constant touch with him during his stay in Kansas nothing was known of any marriage while he was in the West. After that, and until he disappeared, Mrs. Robins said, he never used the name of Taylor, or referred extensively to his visit to the ranch in the West. 'I never really knew Mr. Deane-Tanner's right age,' Mrs. Robins said, 'and I understood that he had been in his country about eight or nine years, when I married him at the Little Church Around the Corner in 1901. He was a fine, lovable man, and I never had occasion to closely question him about his 'past,' which every one seems trying to dig up.' No decision whether Mrs. Robins or her daughter, Ethel, will go to California in connection with the settling of the estate has been reached. Frank E. Schrenseisen of New Rochelle, attorney for Miss Tanner, said that he was awaiting developments and instructions from the office of the Public Administrator in Los Angeles. Another attorney for Miss Tanner has been engaged in Los Angeles. Should the Public Administrator place credence in the story of Taylor, it is probable that Miss Tanner will accompany her attorney to the coast. 'Mr. Deane-Tanner told my daughter that he had made a will in her favor,' Mrs. Robins said, 'and had placed it in his safe deposit box. I understand that this is another one of the items which the police say have strangely 'disappeared.' What he did with it I have no idea, but I feel that the entire matter will be straightened out. Just at present I am hoping that the murderer of Mr. Taylor will be brought to justice for this terrible crime.' Mrs. Robins commented on the strange disappearance of Dennis Deane- Tanner, brother of the murdered director, and said she had never heard a word from him since he left this city in 1912, just four years after her husband disappeared. She said the two brothers had been good friends and business associates, and that Dennis had visited their home at Larchmont on several occasions, and had met many of their friends. There was never any trouble between the brothers as far as she knew, Mrs. Robins said.
1922-02-13	Movie morals are very bad. They are, indeed, almost bad enough to be described in the words of almost any preacher in almost any pulpit speaking for his congregation: 'Oh, Lord, Thou knowest that we are miserable sinners, doing those things we ought not to have done, leaving undone those things we ought to have done.' Moving picture people are nearly as bad as church members. Many of them are church members. And it has been shown that of the people in the penitentiaries over 90 per cent have church affiliations, proving that--well, we'd better not get in too deep. A moving picture man has recently been on trial for manslaughter--at a time when only four or five ministers were on trial for murder, not to mention the murder trial of a clergyman's son who was also the husband of a bishop's daughter. I have my suspicions that a good deal of mischief is going on more or less surreptitiously in moving pictures, although for two years I have been working about a big studio and have never caught anybody kissing anybody except as directed in the picture. I can't say as much for any Sunday school picnic I ever attended. Divorces are very frequent in moving picture colonies. Hollywood is getting to be almost as bad as England, Chicago and some other divorce mills, though it is not yet nearly up to the standard of Indiana, which statisticians have put far ahead of Japan as a dissolver of marriages. Some moving picture people have been known to drink recently. This puts them down with the great majority. Dancing is indulged in by many and few of them favor the old fashioned waltz, which is not called that pure, sweet pastime--but which was once called the devil's favorite device and passion's perdition. Many moving picture people wear a minimum of clothes, but judging from the sermons I read about, this is the case with all the women in the world. In my two years in a picture studio I have not seen a fight (except a rehearsed one). I have heard less profanity than on a college campus. I have seen less jealousy than in a convention of college professors or scientists. I have seen tens of thousands of feet of film taken with never a quarrel, never a voice raised in temper, never a dispute that passed the bounds of artistic debate. Of course unpleasant and evil things happen, just as bad things happen everywhere as happen in the moving picture colonies. The human vices flourish normally because the movie people are human, but the human virtues flourish also for the same reason. In all comparisons, one should avoid the comparison of real people and real conditions with ideal people and conditions, because the ideal is only imaginary. Movie folk should be compared, therefore, with actual classes as they are. They will not suffer by any such juxtaposition. Moralists howl at the movies, but they howl without logic. Vices of every sort ran riot centuries before there were movies. Wicked people enter the movies, but they were wicked before they entered, and they would have gone on being wicked if they had stayed out of them. Pictures intended to appeal to evil emotion have been put on--and will be put on again. But this is true of books, plays, paintings, what not. One of the leading New York clergymen was accused by his congregation recently of trying to draw crowds by preaching salacious sermons. And thousands of clergymen have made use of the same sensationalism. It is a neat trick to denounce indecency so indecently as to attract a morbid crowd. Pulipteers used it for ages before movies were invented. But I feel that the person who is attracted to a picture, a sermon or a play, because (s)he has heard that it is spicy, was already so eager for spice that little harm is done, and a dangerous appetite may be appeased by a little homeopathy. All new arts, all old arts, like old and new religions, professions, races, are, and have been, and will be, denounced by somebody, world without end. If critics could only realize how stale their criticisms are and how carelessly they have been handled. While I do not believe in idolizing or applauding whole classes of people, I am solemnly persuaded that the motion picture people are as good, as kind, as earnest, as pure of heart, as beneficial to the welfare and virtue of the state, as any other class. A man, a woman, a girl or a boy is as safe morally in a motion picture studio as anywhere else. Which is saying much or little. The ridicule and abuse showered upon the movies differ not in the least from the showers that have greeted every other new activity. I am proud to belong to this world, and am proud of its people.
1922-02-13	Coming fast on the latest new and important developments in the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery during the day, District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine late last night hurriedly left his office in his motor car and in company with former Chief of Police Charles A. Jones and Ben Smith, court reporter, started on a quest shrouded in mystery, which is regarded as likely to have a vital bearing on the case. The District Attorney's hurried trip apparently resulted from a conference at his home in which a woman and two men figured. A woman was seen to leave Woolwine's house after an extended visit while the district attorney and Jones were there. She drove away alone but was observed a short time later in her car with a male companion. They drove by Woolwine's house and then disappeared. But whatever transpired during the conference electrified the prosecutor and his aides into instant action. Woolwine and Jones hurried to the Hall of Records in a taxicab where they picked up Smith, the court reporter. Mabel Normand, noted film actress and close friend of the slain director, was reported last night to be dangerously ill, even in more serious condition than on Saturday night, as exclusively told in yesterday's Examiner. It was learned that she is being attended by a trained nurse and is being watched over carefully by her physician. Her condition was said to be so serious that all visitors would be denied entrance to her home for at least ten days. She suffered a severe nervous relapse some days ago. But yesterday it was said that her illness had reached a serious stage as to be regarded as dangerous. One of the most startling bits of information turned over to the investigators was the reported statement of Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored servant, that he expected to see his employer killed. This statement was made, it is said, the day following the robbery of Taylor's home by Sands. Shortly after the last robbery of the slain director's home Peavey is said to have told Harold Freeman, a milkman who delivered milk to the Taylor home, that he expected to find Taylor dead on the morning after the robbery was committed and would not be surprised if he himself were not later killed. Of strange import was Peavey's description, according to Freeman, of how he expected to find Taylor's dead body. The description was said to correspond with the position in which Taylor was found on the morning of February 1 [sic]. Whether this description was merely a strange mixture of superstition and clairvoyance or the result of some information upon which the belief was based is a matter upon which Peavey will be quizzed, according to the officers. Another development of importance concerned information about a woman whom Edward F. Sands, former valet-secretary to Taylor, is alleged to have visited frequently. This information was turned over to the authorities by Freeman. According to Freeman, Sands was in the habit of driving Taylor's car to this woman's house at least once a day during the director's absence in Europe. This address is in the hands of The Examiner but is being withheld at the request of officers who are investigating the clue. Freeman, who says he met Sands every morning for several months, also declared that he saw the fugitive ex-servant shortly after Christmas in front of a downtown theater. Freeman states that he and his wife were standing in front of the showhouse early in the evening when Sands passed. Freeman further declared, it is said, that Sands asserted that he had 'something on Taylor.' On several occasions when Freeman remarked how well Taylor treated his employee, Sands is said to have replied: 'Well, he has to treat me right, for I certainly have the goods on him.' Captain of Detectives David L. Adams, who has heretofore held that the arrest of Sands was the one immediately vital objective toward which the police should bend their efforts, yesterday admitted that officers were now searching for a man whose name has not been mentioned in the case. 'I cannot make public what clues the detectives are following,' said the captain, 'but I will say that if there is an arrest in the very near future it will likely be of a person not previously mentioned in the baffling mystery and who has not been questioned. 'If my men bring in some person who has been a total stranger to the investigation I shall not be surprised. Although I do not look for an arrest today, this is a case in which the unexpected may happen.' The importance the captain attaches to this latest clue may be judged from the fact that he has assigned four of his ablest officers to find and question the man referred to. Detective Sergeant Murphy and another investigator were on an especially important angle, it was said... Captain of Detectives David L. Adams yesterday scouted the theory that the cap found Friday in the room of Walter Thiele, held on a charge of suspicion of burglar, bore out any indication that it, in any way, figured in the Taylor murder case. This cap, brought to the district attorney's office shortly before midnight Friday and shown in the presence of Mabel Normand, the film star, was described by investigating authorities as bearing blood stains. These, if present, are thought to be of minor significance and such as might come from a cut finger and imprinted upon the visor. 'I have not seen the cap, but to the best of my knowledge it has no blood stains whatever, Captain Adams said. 'I have never intimated to anyone that Thiele, in whose rooms it was found, had anything to do with the murder. In fact, I have eliminated both him and his companion, John Dailey, from the slightest suspicion.' Captain Adams did say, however, that a search has been instituted for Dailey, but only for the purpose of charging him jointly with suspicion of burglary in connection with the looting of an apartment house on West Fourth Street at which Dailey had been employed up to February 9 as janitor... A stirring defense was offered for Hollywood and all attackers of the morals, habits or actions of the motion picture profession as a profession were hotly scored last night at a meeting of the Screen Writers' Guild of the Authors' League of America, an organization of well known writers for the films. The meeting was held at the club house, 6716 Sunset Boulevard, and was attended by about 150 persons. Frank E. Woods, president of the organization, suggested a resolution offering $1000 for the capture of the slayer of William Desmond Taylor and made the first contribution of $100. The requested sum was quickly pledged and the motion passed. Those who subscribed $100 apiece besides Woods were: Thompson Buchanan, Albert Shelby Le Vino, J. E. Nash, Frank Condon, Perley Poore Sheehan, Walldemann Young, Wallace Clifton, Miss June Mathis and Walter Woods.
1922-02-13	...'This is one of the quietest days since the murder,' said Capt. of Detectives Adams. 'It is still my opinion that Edward F. Sands is the man we want and I would give anything to get my hands on him. So far as I know only one of the detectives assigned to the case is working today and he is on a line of investigation from which I expect no immediate results.'...
1922-02-13	Los Angeles--...The police were given an astounding new theory as to the murder today, a story of revenge that smoldered for fourteen years to burst out in a sudden deadly blaze of hate--a tip that is hard to verify. It goes back to the days when Taylor was William Cunningham Deane-Tanner of New York, manager of an art story, a husband and a father, the reputed scion of a historic English-Irish family. This new theory comes from an anonymous source, but because it is plausible, the police are making such investigation of it as they can. Taylor met a beautiful young girl in New York some fifteen years ago, according to this story, and fell in love with her. He followed her wherever she went. He called her on the phone and spent hours talking to her. He took her to luncheon and to dinner. The girl was in love with him, too; wanted to become his wife. Taylor never had revealed the fact that he already was married; that he had a daughter. She was the sort of girl Taylor knew who would not allow him to get a divorce. She was clean and pure. No scandal must touch her. Taylor could not live without her and he could not marry her. He disappeared without a word to anyone. It was to him the easiest way for the girl, the hardest for himself. He gave up all he had that he might not harm the woman he loved. He was afraid of himself. The girl wondered and waited and mourned. She did not know what had happened. One night she had been in his arms and they had been talking about their future, the home they were to occupy, the joy that was to walk with them through life, the wonder of their love. And the next night silence, no answer to frantic telephone calls, no messages, no clues. It was as if she had but dreamed a lover and woke to garish reality. Suddenly the girl got up and started to run away. Her mother hastily threw the book to the bench and ran after her daughter. Out of the book slipped a picture. The girl of the story picked up the photograph and looked at it. It was the picture of Tanner. She learned in a little while all there was to know about Tanner. This was his wife. This was his daughter. He had deserted them a year ago-- simply dropped out of sight. Not a word had been heard from him. The girl went home stunned, mortally wounded. She told the story to her brother and then went out to Coney Island. And when the bright morning came men searching the beach came across her body, floating on the waves. The dead girl's brother confided to his friend, a man who had loved her as much as Tanner had. He had been Tanner's rival. He had tried desperately to win her, after Tanner had taken himself away. He had even tried to find Tanner for her, when she convinced him that life without the man was a mockery. This man, the theory has it, is the man who on the night of Wednesday, February 1, shot Taylor, who was Tanner, and stretched him dead on the floor. This man, according to the story, had tried for fourteen years to find the man who had broken the heart of the girl and killed her. He devoted his life to the pursuit. He came on old tracks in Colorado, in Alaska, in Flanders, in France, and finally he picked up the trail. There were no names mentioned in this story, but the man who gave it to the police says he is the brother of the girl who died for love of Tanner, and the police remember that Taylor once said: 'I was in love once, but the woman died.' Perhaps the story is true, they say. Perhaps the New York police can help...
1922-02-13	...Woolwine spent the night with Charles Jones, former police chief, running down leads that cropped up in the investigation. When the district attorney arrived at his office at noon, he gave out a statement to the effect that the quest in the night had proved fruitless. Jones, he said, was in the case to help him on certain angles of the investigation. A rigid investigation of Taylor's loans was urged Monday upon local authorities by legal representatives of persons prominently identified with the film colony. According to Public Administrator Frank Bryson, stubs of Taylor's check books show many loans. Some of these were said to be large and others small. 'Find out to whom these loans were made,' an attorney said, 'and the probability is light will be thrown on the murder.' The theory of Taylor's friends is that the loans were made simply out of his generosity but others believe he was being persistently mulcted by blackmailers. 'It is known,' said one of the men urging the loan investigation, 'that Taylor's bank account was not large, this in spite of the fact that his salary was in excess of $50,000 a year. 'Suppose Taylor got tired of scattering his earnings among these bloodsuckers and refused to 'come through'--wouldn't that be a good background for a murder?' A clue, described as one of the most promising yet uncovered in the Taylor murder, today was expected to lead to an arrest soon. The new clue is connected with the past life of Taylor, who was known in New York as William Dean Tanner, and the man sought for arrest has not previously been mentioned in the case, according to Detective Captain Adams. The new tip was given by a woman whose name is being withheld... Police were given a mysterious tip that about the time Taylor was murdered on the night of February 1, Sands visited a sweetheart in Los Angeles. A close watch on the residence of the girl was established immediately and all her movements were traced. It was reported she was about to leave the city...
1922-02-13	Henry Peavey 'I refuse to talk. If you all wants to talk to me, call the wagon!' Such was the opening statement of Henry Peavey, negro valet of William D. Taylor, slain film director, when pressed for a direct interview Monday. Peavey, who has suddenly become the neighborhood hero on East Third Street since the murder of his master, has persistently refused to talk to newspapermen. Today a reporter, armed with an impressive press badge, sought the elusive Henry in his own haunts. Peavey maintains headquarters in a Jap [sic] rooming house, referred to in that part of the city as a hotel. He also frequents a poolroom a few doors east. Today he was to be found a neither place. The newspaperman, sauntering down the street, sighted Henry perched on a neighboring window ledge surrounded by a group of interested East Third-Streeters. Clad in a greenish brown suit with a pinch-back coat from under which gleamed a spotless white V-necked sweater, Henry basked in the sun and in the consciousness that he was the best-dressed negro in that part of the city. The reporter approached him. 'Henry, I'd like to talk to you,' he said. 'Ah ain't talkin' to no one,' Henry announced. 'If you all wants to talk to me--' The newspaperman drew back his coat until a press badge was visible. Mr. Peavey's eyes widened. 'If you all's from headquatahs, jes call the wagon. Mr. Woolwine, he told me not to talk to nobody.' 'I'm not going to call the wagon. It would create a scene here on the street.' 'Ah don't care,' insisted Peavey. 'They's been too much in the papers.' 'What have they been saying now?' asked the newspaperman, innocently. 'Ah don't know,' Henry said. 'I ain't had the papers read to me this morning. You see, I cain't read or write.' The reporter drew a back of cigarettes and offered one to the negro. He smiled and shook his head. His big brown eyes gleamed from under the visor of his tweed cap. 'Ah never smokes,' he said, 'an' Ah never drinks. That's why Mr. Taylor and me got along so fine together. He never drank very much. He had a bottle of champagne on ice at New Years, an' he says to me, he says, 'Henry, open that bottle, an' we'll split it between us.' 'An' Ah did, an' that was my first drink in two years.' Henry was talking loquaciously now. 'Mr. Taylor never drank 'less it was for sociability,' he explained. 'They say that he an' Miss Normand was drinkin' gin and orange juice the night he was shot. Ah don't know, cause Ah left befo' she did. Anyhow, I nevah knowed much about his private affairs, cause Ah didn't live there. Ah spose if Ah'd slept there, Ah'd known mo' 'em.' 'Have you found a new job yet, Henry?' 'Yassah!' with a pleased smile. 'Say Ah has! Ah'm going to work for Mrs. Christy Cabanne next week, or jes soon as these police and paper men get done axing me questions. 'You see, Ah used to work for her befo' Ah went to work for Mr. Taylor, jes six months ago. Mrs. Cabanne's mother, she made the fust pair pants this chile ever wore.' His big smile beamed again as he recalled the days under his former mistress--the wife of a motion picture producer--and thought of the days to come. 'Ah'll be glad when Ah cooks mah own meals again. Ah eats in these heah restaurants, then Ah goes down the street spittin' to get the bad taste out of mah mouth the whole day long. 'They's nothin' like yo' own cooking.' At the mention of eating, Henry abruptly terminated the interview. He waved an easy goodbye to the reporter, and sauntered down the street, to disappear in the restaurant which he had just branded as the horror of his epicurean existence.
1922-02-13	Neva Gerber Says Taylor Gave Her Checks To Pay for Car and to Make Gifts to Poor LOS ANGELES, Cal, Feb. 12 Neva Gerber, film actress, who has previously stated that she was once engaged to marry William Desmond Taylor, discussed today, in an interview with The Los Angeles Examiner, "the checks" which he said "Mr. Taylor gave me from time to time," "During our engagement," she said, "Mr. Taylor gave me an automobile as a Christmas present. That is, it was understood between Mr. Taylor and myself as a holiday present. "The machine was not all paid for at the time, and in order to prevent gossips from misconstruing the spirit in which the gift was made, Mr. Taylor simply made out checks to me, so I could pay for the care in my own name. "Numerous other checks were for distributing charity to the poor in his behalf. "The last check for $500 given to me  a short time before his death, can be  accounted for very simply: Mr. Taylor  was always looking after my career and doing all he could to help me prodegress in the film world. He knew I was temporarily in financial straits at that time and voluntarily sent me $500." Miss Gerber cashed the last check three weeks before Taylor, was murdered, it was said. The detectives of the Police Department, District Attorney's office and Sheriff's office were dispatched today upon unlikely missions, and most of them reported before nightfall that they had reached the same blank wall encountered in previous investigations. Thomas Lee Woolwine, District Attorney, said he felt that little progress had been made. "We have several lines of investigation upon which a check will be made, probably tonight, but it is impossible to state whether they are vital to the case," the District Attorney said. Both the District Attorney and Capt. David L. Adams, head of the detective bureau, said the man they were most anxious to locate was Edward F. Sands, former secretary and butler of Taylor, who has been missing since last August. 
1922-02-14	This startling story laid before District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine by a bootlegger was under investigation Tuesday: 'I was delivering liquor in half-pint bottles at the Taylor bungalow. I was carrying it in two cases used to pack automobile tire inner cases. I approached the front door from the side of the house. As I reached the shrubbery at the front of the house I heard the shot. 'I stood for three or four seconds--maybe 10--and I saw a woman leave the Taylor bungalow. She hurried away. 'I said to myself: 'This is no place for me,' and I hurried back to my car. I threw the cases into the automobile with such force that I broke a half dozen of the bottles. ' 'Let's go' I told my chauffeur and we beat it east down the street.'
1922-02-14	(Los Angeles)--District Attorney Woolwine today made a statement in which he deplored what he termed 'faked and fraudulent interviews' on the case, and particularly one purporting to have come from him. His statement follows: 'In the early edition of the Examiner for Monday morning there appeared on the first page an interview purporting to come from me which was never in effect given. 'This interview never took place and there is not a word of it that I have ever authorized to be printed nor did I have the slightest intimation, directly or indirectly that it would be. 'There is not a sentence that contains my exact language about anything. It is composed of some things that I have uttered in substance. There are some half truths, many absolute falsehoods. Language purported to have been uttered by me is out of whole cloth and is viciously false. 'It is certainly an outrage for any newspaper to be guilty of such a faked and fraudulent interview. 'I am informed that this fake has been telegraphed all over the United States, which magnified its iniquity.'
1922-02-14	The scene of one phase of importance shifted to Santa Barbara today. The prominent scenario writer and his wife, wanted because they are believed to have known the identity of a missing dope peddler who may have slain Taylor, are sought in the seaside city. They are reported to have gone to Santa Barbara, where the husband expected to work at some of the new studios opening there. Tuesday's developments in the still unsolved murder drew a well-known movie actress closer into the net being spread by county detectives. 'She is not telling all she knows about the murder,' was the statement of one deputy sheriff who has been active on this angle of the investigation. 'This actress is known to have been an intimate of the scenario writer and his wife. The three would take long trips together.' Since the desired information is not forthcoming from the movie actress, the sheriff's office hopes to get it if the scenarist and his wife can be found.
1922-02-14	Search for a missing former song writer well known in moving picture circles extended north of Los Angeles today on a 'tip' that the man wanted for what he may known of the Taylor murder mystery has been seen passing through Santa Barbara. The sudden disappearance of the man has redoubled the interest of the police in his story, and steps have been taken to have him picked up at the earliest moment. The man's description and characteristics are such, according to the police, that it will be impossible for him to conceal himself for any length of time. Strengthening the suspicion that the man has information vital to the solution of the murder mystery, it was learned today that the man suddenly dropped from sight, leaving no trace of his whereabouts. Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz and Deputy Sheriff Frank Dewar, working under the personal direction of Sheriff William I. Traeger, have been busy for several days attempting to trace this man. According to their report he has changed his address several times during the past few months and it has been impossible to locate him. The last effort to find him was made by Biscailuz and Dewar on a secret tip giving them a Hollywood address. On their arrival it was found that he had disappeared some days previous. As a result a widespread search was instituted by the sheriff's office today. It is alleged that if the man is found the activities of a large narcotic ring, alleged to have plotted Taylor's death, will come to light and that eventually still another man suspected of the crime will be apprehended.
1922-02-14	Devotees of the cinema have it straight from Pauline Frederick that all this fuss about the morals of Hollywood is baseless. The famous screen star, with her husband, Dr. Chas. A. Rutherford, and her mother, Mrs. L. Fredericks, arrived Tuesday from the Los Angeles suburb. With the smile that has captivated millions, the vivacious film queen asserted that it is unfair to stigmatize the profession because of one or two unfortunate circumstances. 'I never read the newspapers,' she said, 'and know nothing about this Taylor murder or the Arbuckle case. I never allow them to be discussed in my home. But I do know that I have never seen any more evidence of lax morals in Hollywood's movie colony than anywhere else.' 'You don't mean to say you never read the papers and hear all the good things they say about you and your work?' she was asked. 'Oh, that stuff is all clipped and laid before me,' she answered, 'and of course I do appreciate the nice things, but sometimes I see a real bad one, and that disheartens me for, oh such a long, long time. I wish the public could follow us around Hollywood for awhile,' she added earnestly, 'and they would never be misled by this unwarranted publicity.'
1922-02-14	...While Mr. Woolwine was talking to the visitors to his office, Detectives Cato and Cahill were following up clues uncovered several days ago and leading to the theory that a well-known drug peddler may have been the slayer of the noted film director... Several different theories of the crime were developed during the day, many supposed clues were run down, and many 'tips' were received. But as for actual progress in the baffling case, no official connected with the inquiry admitted making any. Mary Miles Minter, youthful actress who has been questioned as part of the investigation, issued the following statement, authorized by her attorneys: 'There is no person or financial sacrifice that I would not gladly make to bring the slayer of William Desmond Taylor to justice. 'Mr. Taylor was one of my best friends. His death was a great shock to me. I met Mr. Taylor first in 1919, when he became my director. I was then 17 years of age, and his inspiration, his unfailing courtesy and consideration not only to me but to all with whom he came in contact immediately won my highest admiration. 'From 1919 until the day of his death Mr. Taylor was to me the symbol of honor and manliness, an inspiration, friend, guide and counselor--the symbol of all a girl admires in a man. 'His friendship was uplifting and his advice and aid were invaluable. 'It would be nothing less than veritable ingratitude if I did not, now that he is dead, raise my voice to proclaim what he was and to repudiate those who would besmirch his character. 'I have told the authorities all that I know of both his life here and in the East. That, I fear, has been of little aid to them. 'I cannot conceive the character of a person who would voluntarily wrong Mr. Taylor or cause his death.'...
1922-02-14	Mabel Normand says she has the much discussed letters written by her to the late William D. Taylor. They were returned to her yesterday by the District Attorney's office and are, as she says, of such childish, innocent tone that any value they might have either as a sensational feature in the development of this case or as indications of any high emotional nature is absolutely nil. Miss Normand talked at length last night when she heard that a rumor was afloat to the effect that these letters were to be released for publication. 'For myself,' and the star spoke dramatically, 'I had no one who could possibly have been interested enough in me to do such a thing. I had no jealous lovers. My acquaintance among the men and women of Los Angeles was large, but I had never encouraged any one to believe that he was first in my heart and I had only good friends, but no one who could possibly construe my great and beautiful friendship for Mr. Taylor as anything but a most beneficial interest in my life.' 'I have all the letters in my possession,' she said, 'and I am sure that they have not been copied or tampered with. They are all of such a nonsensical nature that they have absolutely no value except as they exhibit and indicate the good fellowship which existed between Mr. Taylor and myself. 'Why, I wouldn't have dreamed of writing anything to him except of a light-hearted nature. Our whole friendship was founded on that line. He was a wonderful man, and a generous man, and many of my notes to him were requests for small contributions for my pet charities. I always gave small checks to the Little Sisters of the Poor, and I frequently asked him to make similar donations. 'He used to urge me to be less extravagant and I wanted to jolly him about his wisdom and at the same time make my own purpose clear to him. I could never refuse any one in distress. I loved to help those about me who were in hard luck, and one of the greatest pleasures that my success in pictures has brought me was that it enabled me to give freely to those who needed money. The only value I could see in a large salary was to be able to help those less fortunate than I. 'My letters were all so childish and so simple that they could have meant nothing but perhaps a moment's cheer to so wonderful a man as was Mr. Taylor. He was a fine, clean, wholesome man, and he spurred my ambition and made me study. He wasn't like younger men who always wanted me to put on evening clothes and go out somewhere to dance and dine. He liked to sit at home and talk about books. He helped me so much with my reading and study and encouraged me to think that some time I might accomplish something along that line.' Miss Normand recited from memory several of her letters to Mr. Taylor, which all bore out her statements in regard to the merry exchange of badinage between them. One letter referred to a little lark in which they had indulged one evening when they went to see a motion picture. She had dismissed her chauffeur and decided to go to another theater where a star whom she admired, Richard Barthelmess, was to be seen. 'I thought it would be fun to ride in a Ford,' said the beautiful young actress, 'so I asked a car passing if they would drive us to the next theater and Mr. Taylor and I rode and paid fifty cents for the trip. We thought it a lot of fun. 'Later we walked back to the first theater to see the beginning of the film, and on the way down the street talked about the art of the cinema, and the play itself. 'The next day I had a long letter of advice from Mr. Taylor, which was really a burlesque. He chided me for the reckless expenditure of the fifty cents, joking of course, and laughed at my enjoyment of this harmless little escapade. All our letters were exchanged in just that tone. 'You know,' added Miss Normand, 'film people work hard. They have to work at night and sometimes for days at a time have little leisure away from the set. Such frivolous notes as those Mr. Taylor and I exchanged were merely a brief recreation for both of us. They never had serious portent, and were always as light-hearted and merry as we could make them. Many of our hours were passed in the most serious kind of labor.' Miss Normand is visibly unnerved by the long strain of questioning to which she has been subjected. She feels more than anything else, however, a fierce sense of injustice to the dead. 'How can people say such terrible things about him?' she asked. 'How can those very folk with whom he was associated, the men and women he helped either with movies or friendliness think for a moment that any of those unkind things be true? It is impossible for me to consider it and I think instead of passing resolutions his friends, every one of them, should form a huge fund and offer a tremendous reward for the capture of the man who killed him. 'Every one who could should contribute even if it is only five dollars or one dollar, and many of his associates should easily give a thousand dollars and would, I believe, be glad to do so to have this terrible mystery explained. I am sure Mr. Taylor had no enemies of whom he was aware. He was a man of such open habits, such a sincere and honest man, that he could never have wrought an injustice that could animate such a terrible, vindictive act. 'The murderer must be found and punished, and I should be very glad to head a list of subscribers to such a fund if others in the industry believe that it is the right thing to do. 'It's easy enough to say, 'Oh, what a fine man he was--such a loss to the profession,' but that doesn't count in the punishment of the man who did this terrible deed. I believe that his associates will be ready in a moment to start such a fund and to make the solution of this crime a quick and sure matter. 'I have been put to terrific agony by this whole terrible event, but I make nothing of my own suffering as compared with the unclean things which have been said about the motion picture industry. The shock to me when I learned of the death of my good friend was almost unendurable, but before I could rally from that I was questioned and almost stunned by the knowledge of the horrible suspicions which this crime has wakened about the entire colony of picture folk. 'Such allegations are absolutely unfair. It is, of course, the fault of circumstances that I was the last person known to have seen Mr. Taylor, and I give thanks every day that on that particular evening I had driven to his house in my big car with my chauffeur in attendance. Sometimes I did get into my little Stutz and we went to drive together, and it is the greatest comfort to me how in this hour of distress that I had gone with attendants on that night.' Here Miss Normand broke down completely and her slight frame, emaciated and worn from the stress of the past two weeks, shook with an attack of terrific coughing. 'Oh, they are talking about sending me away for the winter,' she moaned. 'This cough is so threatening, and the doctors are afraid my lungs my suffer unless I get to a drier climate.' Miss Normand was asked concerning the wife and daughter of Mr. Taylor. 'Why, what reason do they give for not coming out here at such a time?' she exclaimed. 'If I had been that daughter with such a wonderful father nothing could have prevented my coming here at once. A father like that should make any girl proud and eager to do all in her power to solve this terrible mystery. I can't understand how she could have been indifferent to such a man.' Miss Normand did not know that Mr. Taylor had a daughter until the developments following his death, but said that long ago she had heard it mentioned that he had once been married. The star's rooms are filled with flowers and notes and telegrams of love and affection are constantly reaching her from all parts of the world. The strange fate which included her so closely in the final movements of Mr. Taylor's life has necessarily brought upon her a double burden. She is almost prostrated with grief, and has also the necessity of trying in every way she can to throw some light upon the animating cause which could have brought about so frightful a crime. She has strained every nerve in her endeavor to assist the progress of justice, and the result is almost more than her fragile physique can withstand. But her loyalty to her friend is leading her to put forth every effort, and in her desire to help unveil the identity of the mysterious slayer she is now almost at the point of total collapse. She was feeling much stronger last night, however, and with another day of rest her physicians believe she will be on the high road to the recovery of that buoyant health and spirit which is so notable a quality both in her social and professional life.
1922-02-14	A powerful ring of narcotic peddlers alleged to have been operating in Los Angeles and Hollywood and directed and led by a beautiful woman was the center of investigation last night by officers conducing search for the slayer of William Desmond Taylor, film director. The nefarious activities of the members of this band who have drawn the suspicions of the investigators were uncovered yesterday by Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz and Deputy Sheriff Frank Dewar, working under the direction of Sheriff William I. Traeger. After carrying out a thorough search for the members of the ring the officers announced that they had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared from their usual haunts about the city. Police have traced the movements of this beautiful woman for the past few months and have found, they say, that although she moved frequently, her home was never located far from the house occupied by Taylor. The fact that none of the peddlers could be found yesterday is looked upon by the officers as a strong link in the chain which they are trying to forge about the band. Another important development yesterday was the added declaration of George F. Arto, a machinist, living on Bixel Street, that he saw a third man in front of the court, on Alvarado Street, where Taylor lived, on the night of the murder--a man other than Henry Peavey, the film director's valet, and William Davis, Mabel Normand's chauffeur. This third man, he asserts, was talking with Peavey. Davis was sitting in the car at the time. Arto, called to the District Attorney's office last Friday, related the alleged occurrence, but was not certain that he made this observation on the night of the murder. Yesterday, by exchanging notes with the friend and others, he established the fact that his visit was made on the night of February 1. Davis, upon being shown Arto's statement, reiterated that with the exception of Peavey there was no one present the night of February 1 while he waited for Miss Normand to come from the director's house. Peavey made the same statement. Following an hour's investigation yesterday afternoon between Charles A. Jones, a special investigator of the case, and other officials eight persons were taken to the District Attorney's office. Five of them were witnesses. Although the subject of the conference was not divulged it helped clear away many baseless rumors which have hindered progress. It is expected that today Detective Sergeant J. E. Winn will be assigned to the personal staff of the District Attorney to handle the murder case in the place of Detective Sergeant Eddie King, who is ill. Rumors that two new women witnesses were called to the District Attorney's office yesterday were denied by detectives. Dr. Dudley Fulton, Miss Mabel Normand's physician, yesterday issued orders that no one, not even her most intimate friends, should see the film star... Announcement by the district attorney's office that a number of letters had been found in the dead man's effects from women who had not been mentioned in the case caused something of a stir until an examination showed that they threw no light on the mystery. The identity of the mystery witness examined late Sunday night by the district attorney and Special Investigator Charles A. Jones was not revealed yesterday. It was announced, however, that no material fact had been adduced in the lengthy statement, which was taken down in shorthand by court Reporter Ben Smith... That a rigid investigation of all business papers found in Taylor's effects will be made at once was the statement from the District Attorney's office and public administrator's office yesterday. Frank Bryson, the administrator, wants to secure the last possible detail on the slain man's affairs so that the daughter and whoever, if anyone, else enters into the estate shall have a full accounting. Already there have been discovered many check stubs showing that Taylor paid out, in the aggregate, a large sum of money which, so far as may be judged, is due the estate. While it does not appear to be legally collectible, neither notes nor other security having been given, the presumption is that many of the checks to various individuals stood for money loaned. Thus far there has not been found a single entry in the unfortunate man's check stubs or elsewhere which points the way to the perpetrator of the crime. It is believed by some of the authorities that, to learn the names of all the borrowers of the director's generously disbursed funds might bring a solution to the mystery. This is on the theory that he may have loaned a large amount to some person who preferred to wipe out the debt in blood rather than money.
1922-02-14	Declaring that the widely exploited scandals charged to the motion picture industry in Los Angeles are brought about by a few, and not the majority, as a result of which Hollywood has been reflected all over the country as a den of iniquity, a sink of vice, and pest hole of drug addicts and various other euphonious and striking titles, editors of local newspapers, leaders in the motion picture industry and members of the Screen Writers Guild met yesterday at the Chamber of Commerce to discuss plans to fight such publicity in every way possible... During the conference a frank and full discussion of the press in its relation to the motion picture industry was participated in by Joseph W. Schenck, Jesse L. Lasky, Frank Woods and others representing the Producers and Screen Writers' Guild, as well as G. G. young of The Examiner, Harry Chandler, president and general manager of a morning paper [The Times]; Edward A. Dickson, editor of The Express; Edwin R. Collins, managing editor of The Herald, and Burton Kulsley, editor of the Record...
1922-02-14	Lacking real clews to explain the mystery of the murder of William Desmond Taylor, the motion-picture director, public curiosity has turned ravenously upon the private affairs of the movie actors. Not only have the innermost facts of the life of the murdered man been thrown to the winds, but every young girl who knew Taylor by sight seems to be considered legitimate prey. Private papers found in the apartments of the murdered man have been shouted from the housetops. With a bloodhound ferocity the pack-and-cry is in full pursuit of every stain in the life of everyone connected with the motion-picture industry. It seems cruel and unnecessary that the letters of young girls should be ruthlessly flung to the world to read for no other reason than the slim excuse that they were found in the house of the murdered man. There is no pretense on the part of anyone that these missives have any possible bearing upon the murder mystery. That some very young girl in the glow of a romance should write, 'I love you; I love you; I love you,' to a man old enough to be her father is no very terrible indictment. In any event, there is no reason why she should be exposed to scorn, ridicule and disgrace--just because the man to whom they were addressed happened to fall a victim to an assassin's bullet. Not only have these letters been pitilessly and mercilessly displayed to the public; but some of them have been printed in such a way as to leave the most vicious possible inferences. Against these nasty inferences the young girls in question have no defense. It is, for them, a case of 'Be damned if you do; be damned if you don't.' The only possible explanation they could make would be to lay still barer their innermost private secrets. In the opinion of The Times the public has no right to any papers or letters in this or any other case that does not have a direct and official connection with the untanglement of this mystery; unless they would, for instance, be considered proper evidence in a murder case on trial. The doctrine that every private letter and every secret of every kind found in a house where a crime has been committed should be published is a dangerous one. There are few who have not written letters, who have not, in fact, had experiences that they would shrink from seeing on the public billboards. The fact that the girl writers of the letters happen, in this case, to have been young, beautiful and world-famous does not take away their rights. Their fault was to fail to recognize that persons in the public eye must suffer from restrictions as to their conduct in private life which are not imposed upon individuals 'to fame and fortune unknown.' The Times is not impelled to protest against the procedure in this instance because those concerned happen to be connected with one of our most important industries. It is not a question of economics or business, but one of common justice. The Times has always refused to suppress news. The public is entitled to know the legitimate and relevant facts about this and all other matters of genuine public interest, even though these facts cause discomfort. But The Times does contend that to drag the bottom of the sea for every shred and putrid remnant of gossip and scandal affecting every person who had a speaking acquaintance with a murdered man is unjust, outrageous, unsafe, unethical, ungenerous--and mighty bad business.
1922-02-14	LYNN BARS MINTER FILM. Censors Declare Against Pictures of  Persons in Taylor Case. Special to The New York Times. LYNN. Mass., Feb. 13. —The Board of  Theatrical Censors in Lynn requested  today that no showing be made of a  film featuring Mary Miles Minter, which  was scheduled for the last three days of  this meet at a local theatre. The board  also requested that other films in which  actresses appear whose names have been  connected vith the death of William  Desmond Taylor be kept off the screens  of theatres in Lynn. A motion picture vith Mabel Normand  as the star, and which as contracted  for some weehs ago, as shovn yesterday, but it will be shown no more. The  action of the board folloved protests  made by persons who saw Miss Minter  in a film this evening.
1922-02-15	We ought to be glad this thing happened down in Los Angeles--that is, glad that it happened in Los Angeles instead of Seattle. It was a 'big' murder, as the news boys put it, and--like all big things--we need the distance to give us a proper perspective. We were just about to despair of the movies giving us any thrills other than those in the films themselves. Fatty Arbuckle gave us a good show--while it lasted. [51] But he has gone through his second trial, and it drew so poorly that District Attorney Brady threatens positively to withdraw it after one more performance. Things were slowing up badly. California was having a rotten winter. Tourists were leaving. And then-- Action! Action! William Desmond Taylor, world's greatest movie director, British army captain, art connoisseur, traveler, dilettante, divorcee, bon vivant, occultist, et cetera, et cetera, as well as sole proprietor of the finest, best appointed, most frequently visited and most generously occupied love nest in the city of Los Angeles--William Desmond Taylor, Love Avalanche of Alvarado, [52] is found dead! Once again Los Angeles triumphed over her ancient, jealous sister. San Francisco could claim the Arbuckle affair. It was small, sordid; did not offer the element of mystery; just a plain drunk, with a killing for a chaser. Bah! In Los Angeles a real he-man bit the dust--a sure-enough lady killer, with more handkerchiefs, gloves, powder puffs and pale-and-thin lingerie in his trophy list than an Arbuckle could ever hope to bag with all the seeming advantage of superior booze and top weight. And compare the women in the case. Fatty's list of 'those present' might be the register of the Home for Dessicated, Debilitated and Flatfooted Hashers. Who remembers them? Fatty had to bait with booze for his moths in order to get them to circulate around the formless, only partly combustible hunk of tallow that was Arbuckle, in the hope that one at least might get drunk enough to fall in. Now look--if your eyes be not too dazzled--look, look at the lambent flame of Desmond Taylor. Mark that classy galaxy that moves in queenly strides around the central orb. Think you they are drawn and held by sordid things? Not so. S'love, s'love! The Arbuckle setting was one of corks, empties, cigarette butts and katzenjammers. [53] Taylor died surrounded by incense, code love notes, monogramed hankies and pink teddy-bears. [54] The sauce piquante of the Taylor affair would be a fetching dressing to pour over even the classiest of chicken served up on the silver screen.
1922-02-15	After a pitched battle last night between officers and a band of suspected blackmailers and professional gunmen at College Street and North Broadway, eight men were lodged in the County jail where they will be held for investigation and subjected to a severe grilling for possible implication in the William Desmond Taylor slaying.
1922-02-15	Most of the folly and most of the ecstasy of the world has been written into love letters. Down Los Angeles way the sudden taking off of a motion picture director has revealed in superlative quantity the common impulse that exists to let the emotions expand under the witching stimulus of a flowing pen. One love letter is very like another; in this one thing the world changeth never. It has all been said. Dido might have held the pen of Mabel Normand in the hour she suspected Aeneas had his mind set on his famous getaway; Cleopatra might have written like the Minter girl when Antony's eye seemed to be roving a trifle free. Nothing original is to be found in love- letters, probably because there is nothing original in love. This is not astonishing. The thing that bemuses understanding is that in this day of highly-developed inventive genius no substitute has been adopted for the paper-and-pen love letter. What is disappearing ink for if not kindly to erase the follies of yesterday under the blushing second though of today? Should it not be a Medean law that all love letters are returnable to the sender by registered return mail, special delivery? Apparently the itch to write may not be appeased and the letters must be written; but must we and our children and generations yet unborn forever read and re-read the eternal secret of what one person thinks of another in that 'first fine careless rapture,' or otherwise, which is found in the love letter?
1922-02-15	The American public is ardent in its hero worship and quite as ruthless in destroying its idols in any walk of life. 'It elevates a man more quickly than any nation in the world, and casts him down more quickly--quite often on surmise or a mere hunch. 'This latter disposition so curiously at variance with the American tradition and ideal of justice is just now being driven home particularly to the motion picture people of Los Angeles on the heels of Billy Taylor's mysterious murder.' Such was the comment today by 'Fatty' Arbuckle on one aftermath angle of the noted picture director's assassination in his home here on the night of February 1. He was decrying certain innuendos cast against William Desmond Taylor, his life and his relationship with women screen stars whose names have featured the investigations. Arbuckle is back in his West Adams mansion after his second court ordeal in connection with the death of Virginia Rappe in San Francisco. 'It is the general inclination, when trouble happens to strike in film circles, for the thoughtless to whisper, malign and gossip and to speak with that mock sagacity of the times of 'the inside dope' and 'the low down,'' continued Arbuckle. 'This was brought out quite forcibly in my own case and has been accentuated in the case of William Taylor. That I will acquit myself I am quite sure, but poor Billy is not here to defend himself from speculations which have no basis in proven fact. 'Taylor lived as he died--a square shooter, absolutely on the level with his fellow beings, charitable and kind. His death removed from the motion picture industry one of its outstanding characters. To this hundreds who knew him best testify. 'And yet, because of that curious and pervading psychology of suspicion to which I have referred, Billy Taylor's name is in many quarters being smirched with utter disregard for the facts of his personal and professional life. 'That is far from the dominant trait of our forefathers, who held a man innocent until proven guilty. And I know the full weight of this vilification and innuendo because I was a victim of the same campaign. 'Never in history, perhaps, have men and women been so quickly elevated to prominence as have the successful folk in pictures. That is because of the millions before whom they appear via the screen almost nightly. Their names become household words. Their features widely familiar. They are virtually next door neighbor to everyone in the land. 'The man and woman who thus accepts as worthy of esteem this filmland neighbor should do himself or herself the moral honor of refusing to accept tattle and shouldershrugs in place of fact--as he undoubtedly would in the case of his respected physical neighbor.'
1922-02-16	William Davis, Mabel Normand's chauffeur, was questioned again today. He told of driving Miss Normand to the apartment court in South Alvarado street, of reaching there about 7:15, of seeing Miss Normand disappear into the court in the direction of Taylor's home, of her reappearance with Taylor after about half an hour, of her chatting with Taylor for a moment at the curb and of the actress's waving good-by as the car moved off. He also told how Henry Peavey, Taylor's butler, left the house while Miss Normand was still there, and of stopping to pass a word with him beside the automobile. This conversation, Davis said today, was brief, for as he comes from the South, he explained, it is not his habit to exchange idle gossip with Southerners of darker hue.
1922-02-16	--Movie Publicity Man in Recent Interview) The Publicity Man wore a pair of gumshoes [2] and his suit was the somberest black. He walked down the alley and looked all about that nobody followed his track. He had on a mask and his cap was pulled down and you never would know it was he. He came in the back door with a soft, stealthy step, as quiet as quiet could be. He looked all about and he stole up the stairs where the dramatic editor sat. His tread was so light and his knock on the door was the quietest rat-a-tat-tat. And the editor asked what the news of the stars, for he knew there must be, more or less. The Publicity Man whispered low and he said: 'Sh-h-h! We are keeping their names from the press!' The Publicity Man had no picture or scroll or lay-out or story or such. He was mum as an oyster and still as could be with a blue pencil fast in his clutch. And the editor said: 'I will run a weird tale of the slim stars and short ones and stout.' The Publicity Man all a-tremble and pale, said: 'Oh, Editor, pray, cut it out!' The the Editor said: 'What's the matter, old boy? What's the which and the why and the how?' 'The stars want a rest,' so the other replied. 'There is too much publicity now! We have had so much stuff of their furs and their gowns and their hair and their winning red lips. Till they're simply worn out with the strain of it all and just now all they want is eclipse.' The Publicity Man gathered up all the stuff that the editor had on his hook And he looked all about and he whispered goodby with a frightened and furtive look. Then he put back his mask and he stole out the door and he dropped down a coal hole to hide. For the soul of the man was all stricken and sad, and all humbled and sore was his pride. Then he came out at dark and he gumshoed his way to the place where he wrote his weird stuff And he turned out the lights and he sat in the dark and he said: 'I'm an old bird and tough, And I've seen some of life as it comes and it goes, as much as a man can, I guess, But I never once thought in the whole of my days I'd be keeping things out of the press.'
1922-02-16	No end of letters from cranks are pouring into the investigative offices. Police Captain Adams says it beats anything in his nineteen years' experience. He has time to read only a few of them. One writes from Oregon that he did it, and adds, 'I am leaving Portland tonight, but whether north, south, east or west I don't say. Come and find me.' All these letters are being studied on the chance that one of them might yield pay dirt, but thus far they have proved merely vexations and time wasting.
1922-02-16	Stern Resolve of a Moral Young Man I'll never be a movie star Though ten directors trail me; In Hollywood, the chances are, They'd either shoot or jail me. Those horrid habit-forming drugs! Those vamps, so blond and frisky! I'm safer here among the thugs, A-drinking moonshine whisky.
1922-02-16	The burning love of a film idol for his wife, which first drove him into frenzies of despair and finally to murder, was whispered about the Hall of Records today as the real solution of the mystery surrounding the death of William D. Taylor. And on the strength of this story a state-wide search has been instituted for the actor, formerly associated with one of the largest film producing organizations in Southern California, and for his wife. The woman is said by the authorities to still be in the vicinity of Los Angeles. The man, it is feared, has fled. According to information in the hands of the authorities, the man in question was called to the East in connection with the production of a picture about five months ago. He was absent for two months. During that period, it is asserted, his wife, who also acts before the camera, was seen several times with Taylor. Whether or not this man, consumed by the fires of jealousy, spied upon his wife and, believing her to be infatuated with Taylor, killed him, is not publicly known. Investigators decline to discuss the case, but it is indicated that the details of the situation are in their possession and they are of sufficient importance to warrant a widespread investigation.
1922-02-16	Warning his audience against the 'think as I think; do as I do' fanatical minority, David Wark Griffith, moving picture producer, yesterday made a general defense of the industry in which he is such a prominent figure and pleaded for a greater tolerance at a luncheon of the Advertising Club of New York at its headquarters, 47 East Twenty-Fifth Street. Mr. Griffith did not undertake to reply specifically to the charges of the Rev. Dr. John Roach Straton, not even alluding to his attack on the stage and the films. Nor did he attempt a detailed defense of the moving picture colony at Hollywood. Mr. Griffith said, in fact, that he knew nothing about Hollywood, hadn't been there in four years and didn't know very many film people. He has known and does know women and men in the moving picture game who are 'as sweet and clean as any women in the world,' women that any of the men present would be glad to have as wives or sisters. Referring to his production of 'Intolerance,' which deals with the old witchcraft persecutions, Mr. Griffith said that he did not enjoy producing that story, but considered it a duty to do so. 'Let one, two or three start on the mad hunt and the whole pack is again heard,' continued Mr. Griffith; 'and how they hunt them down and persecute them! History tells us that nine million men and women fell victims of this dread thing. How they made them suffer! They dismembered the living, tore nails from their finger--all for religion. Yet this was not religion. 'It was the class that says 'Think as I think, do as I do,' and if you do not think as they think and do as they do off comes your head. 'This type of man is very much alive in America today. We who have a land and a Constitution bought by the blood of countless sacrifices must be on our guard lest these 'think-as-I-think-do-as-I-do' people rob us of this heritage. 'The power of the sincere fanatical minority is tremendous, and lest we watch our step law will be added to law to further circumvent our liberties. One law and then another law is put on the statute books to make people good by law--a gross, absurd impossibility. Laws that are not obeyed are disregarded until we lose respect for all laws. 'No, I don't know anything about the morals of Hollywood, but I was raised in a strict Methodist family in Kentucky. It was the strictest sort of a family. Theatres and dances were barred absolutely and I knew how good those good men and women were. I know men and women engaged in producing motion pictures that you or I would be glad to have in our families. 'This sounds like a defense of the movies. But there should be no defense. Shall we attack banks when a banker gets into the newspapers or the church when a minister gets into the newspapers? There is nothing new in finding conditions such as the papers have been telling about recently. In this morning's paper I saw that a priest had been arrested charged with the murder of his brother. A few days ago I read that the records of the Atlanta penitentiary show three minister inmates to each actor. 'Neither the actor nor the minister should be in prison. It doesn't mean anything against the religion of Christ if occasionally a minister falls from grace. The moving picture people are just the same as all the other humans who people this earth. They are just as high as the plumber, the bricklayer or the farmer and just as low as those who dream of [...] beauty and gold to their idealism. I have seen such sweet ideals, such sweet dreams in our business. This is not just talk, but the plain truth.' Mr. Griffith explained his lack of knowledge of Hollywood gossip by saying that his work occupied his time from fourteen to fifteen hours each day. Frank Feldman, president of the club, in presenting Mr. Griffith introduced him as the dean of the motion picture business and declared that if that industry had more Griffiths it would not have had many of the troubles of the last few years.
1922-02-16	FILM STARS ARE NOW EXAMINED SECRETLY Los Angeles Prosecutor says  Publicity Resulted in Some  Asking Private Hearing. TAYLOR'S YOUTH REVEALED $2,500 Is Added to Reward for  Apprehension of Slayer, Making the Total $4, 500.   Special to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 15.— An  admission by District Attorney Woolwine today that his investigation of the  Villiam Desmond Taylor murder mystery s being carried on " under cover " to the extent that dozens of witnesses  are being questioned secretly was followed by reports that out of the tangled  skein of evidence he has worked out a  definite theory for the crime. Indications that Woolwine is now directing the investigation along a line to develop his theory of a motive for the  murder mere seen in the closely guarded  activities of his investigators. They mere scattered over the city on secret missions today, reporting hourly to the  District Attorney by telephone. Woolwine admitted that because of the  publicity attendant upon the appearance  of certain witnesses at the District Attorneyts office they have refused to name statements concerning the case  unless they are questioned at their  homes, or elsevhere, in private. Woolwine declined to name any of the  witnesses who have been examined in  secret, asserting that but little progress has been made in the investigation. At the same time detectives, with the  aid of a girl sweetheart in Los Angeles, have set a trap for Edward F. Sands,  former secretary of the slain man, now  sought as a suspect in the murder case. In an effort to locate Sands, the girl, whose name is withheld at the request of the authorities and who is working in the closest co-operation with them,  as written to every point where she believes he may have gone into hiding.   Agreed to "Tip"  Detectives.  Questioned soon after the murder when suspicion was first directed against  Sands, the girl agreed to " tip " the detectives as soon as she heard from him. Since the trap as set the girl has  worhed industriously vith the detectives to find some trace of Sands and to le cate him through mutual friends. Woolwine's investigators plan to question William Davis, chauffeur for Mabel Normand, for the second time. Information received by the Sheriff 's office was said to have caused Woolwine to order  that Davis be questioned again. When he made a statement to the District Attorney several days ago Davis corroborated the story of Miss Normand that she called at the Taylor home on the nlight of the murder to get a book which Taylor had promised her, and that she  left there prior to the slaying.  Charles Jones, former Chief of Police,  and now acting as a special investiga tor in the case for Woolwine, was ex pected to interviev Mrs. J. M. Berger, income tax expert, during the day. Mrs. Berger was assisting Taylor to prepare  his income tax report  for several days  before his death, and talked with him over the telephone between 5: 30 and 6:30 o'clock on the night of the murder. Mrs.  Berger has stated that her  conversation  vith Taylor over the telephone concerned his income tax report.    Says Now He can Clear Arbuckle. The San Francisco police lost interest  today in the story of Charles Carson,  retired sea captain,  that he knew of two  men whom Sands had employed to " get even " with a Los Angeles motion picture director. Carson, after telling  his story  concerning the Taylor case, declared now that he knows a man who can clear  Roscoe " Fatty " Arbuckle  of the manslaughter charge against him in connection with the death of Virginia Rappe. Investigation of Carson's story at Sands continued however. Woolwine's investigation of reports that a bootlegger delivering liquor to  the Taylor home had heard the shot and saw a woman leaving the house has shown the story to be without  foundation. The socalled " bootlegger "  was a man who denies ever having sold  liquor and who says he heard the story second  hand. A reward of $2, 500 has been offered by the Famous Players-Laskey Corporation, which employed Taylor as a director, for information resulting in the arrest and conviction of the slayer. This  offer makes the total of rewards in the  case $4,500. The theory that blackmailers may have killed Taylor as weakened today when it was discovered that reports that  Taylor drew $2,500 from the bank the day before the murder and re-deposited  it a few hours before he as killed could not be confirmed. Checking over  Taylor's bank accounts, investigators  were unable to find any trace of the $2,500. It was found, however, that Tay lor deposited $1,600, his salary for two  weeks, in the bank on the day he as  slain.  Information concerning Taylor's early life and his family has been received  from Cappoquin, Ireland, the informant  being William Coss, an old coachman,  who knew Taylor as a boy under his  real name of William Cunningham  DeaneTanner. Coss said that Taylor was born in Carlow in 1877 and had two  sisters and a brother, Dennis Deane Tanner. He said Major DeaneTanner,  is father, was very harsh to his son  William. Coss said that Major Deane-Tanner sent William to Sandhurst to train for the army, but that his son failed to pass the tests, which enraged him. One of Taylor 's sisters is dead and the other is the wife of an officer in the British Army, the old coachman said.
1922-02-17	A third of the detectives hunting for the criminal in a sensational murder case have the grippe, [13] thus winning relief from the ancient jest which represents a detective as unable to catch even a disease.
1922-02-17	The Taylor murder is proving costly to practically all coast production companies at this time. Star, director and cameraman have been busily engaged in the discussion of the case each morning at a time they are scheduled to 'shoot.' It is safe to say an hour or two were wasted daily last week on all of the bigger lots as the result of the 'post mortem' the Los Angeles dailies were holding over the character of the slain man.
1922-02-17	The theory that Taylor was slain for money was revived Friday when Mrs. J. M. Berger, income tax expert, reported that the film director had a large roll of bills in his possession when she talked to him at 4 o'clock on the afternoon of the day he was murdered. W. T. Hammond, cashier at the First National Bank, where Taylor kept his accounts, said that the director made no deposit that day. When found murdered Taylor had a flat wad of bills, amounting to $70 in a pocket. Mrs. Berger thinks the roll she saw was much larger than this. Following her statement Friday the theory was advanced that Taylor was killed by a blackmailer after he had given the man the roll of bills. After the crime the slayer could have departed hastily, taking with him the money he received from Taylor, but not disturbing the money and jewelry on his person.
1922-02-17	SEEK WOMAN IN CAR IN TAYLOR MYSTERY Los Angeles Detectives Hunt for Girl Who Drove Through Ventura on Night of Murder. GARAGE MAN TELLS Of HER Mabel Normand 's Chauffeur Is Examined-Search for Second Deposit Box.   Special to The New York Times. Los ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 16 .-A young woman, wrapped in an evening cloak and bareheaded, who drove through Ventura, Cal., at 3 oclock in the morning after William Desmond Taylor was murdered, was sought today by detectives. Information concerning the woman, who appeared, it is said, to be fleeing from Los Angeles, was  given to the authorities by a garage man who supplied her with gasoline and oil in the early hours of the day following the slaying. "She was in evening dress and wore a cloak," the man said. " I saw her machine before she reached my garage and she was driving at a terrific speed. As she stopped I noticed that her face was drawn and pale and that her hair had been blown down by the force of wind as she drove. "Give me all the gasoline and oil my car will take," she said. "While I was filling the tank I noticed she bit at her white gloves with her teeth and showed other signs of restlessness and anxiety to be on her way. She paid me with a bill and drove off without waiting to receive her change." The man furnished the license number of the care as he remembered it and described the machine and the woman in detail. A search of the records of telegraph companies in Loss Angeles for copies of telegrams received and sent by Taylor shortly before his death was today ordered by Woolwine. Several telegrams were reported to have been found. Other investigators renewed today the search for a second safety deposit box which Taylor is believed to have had. Information furnished by Miss R. M. Berger, income tax specialist, caused the renewal of the search for a box believed to contain several thousand dollars. worth of oil stock and a considerable amount of cash. Miss Berger informed Charles Jones, former Chief of Police, who is acting as a special investigator for Woolwine, that Taylor employed her to aid him in making his income tax report and that he listed the oil stock and cash, which as yet have not been located. Corroboration of the story told by Mabel Normand, the last person who saw Taylor alive, was furnished today by her chauffeur, William Davis, when he accompanied Deputy Sheriffs to 404-B South Alvarado Street, Taylor 's home. Davis was questioned at the scene of the crime by deputies. Davis illustrated how he waited in Miss Normand 's automobile while she was inside with Taylor, how he saw Taylor and Miss Normand come out to the car and how Taylor waved to the actress as they left at 7:40 o'clock, a few minutes before the murder. The chauffeur said he spoke to Henry Peavey, Taylor 's negro valet-cook, while he was waiting for Miss Normand, who had purchased a bag of peanuts and a copy of the Police Gazette before going to the house. Peanut shells, which Davis said he swept from the automobile while Miss Normand was talking to Taylor in the house, were found in the parkway. Davis said that Taylor appeared in good humor and without sign of any fear or worry. Davis was asked if he had noticed a book in Miss Normand 's hand, when she returned to the machine. Miss Normand told Woolwine that she went to Taylor 's home to get a book which he had promised her. " She may have had a book, but I did not see it," Davis said.
1922-02-18	(New York)--While Hollywood and its environs are having considerable trouble solving their recent murder murder mystery, Master Voros goes merrily on his mind-reading way down at the New Amsterdam Roof, and the management is seriously--so it asserts--considering a plan to turn him loose on the Taylor case. It appears Voros can read any one's mind by looking at the back of his neck, and he even solves make-believe murder mysteries in the same way when two or three members of the audience get their heads together and frame such a circumstance. If the young man can do this when there hasn't been any killing at all, reasons the management, how much more easily will it be for him to unearth the culprit when there has actually been a crime committed.
1922-02-18	LETTER FROM 'SANDS' OFFERS TO CLEAR UP  THE TAYLOR MURDER. Writer, Asserting He Is Man Sought, Asks Dismissal of the Other Charges. SAYS HE KNOWS SLAYER District Attorney, Replying Through the Press, Agrees to All His Conditions. SLAIN MAN WORE LOCKET it was Gift From Mabel Normand, It is said, and Was Inscribed "To My Dearest."   Los ANGELES, Feb. 17.Immunity for Edward F. Sands from prosecution on a charge of embezzlement preferred against him last August by William Desmond Taylor, murdered film director, was promised tonight by Thomas Lee Woolwine, District Attorney, provided Sands proves his innocence of the murder and can "untangle this murder mystery." Mr. Woolwine 's promise to the missing former butler-secretary was made in a letter he addressed "To Edward F. Sands, through the publishers " in answer to a letter he received and which purported to have been written by Sands. The letter which was signed "E. F. Sands," was dated Feb. 14. The writer declared he was living in Loss Angeles and inquired whether if he surrendered and established his innocence of the murder of Taylor, he would be freed of the embezzlement charge. A copy of the letter was made public by Mr. Woolwine, as follows: Los Angeles, Feb, 14, 1922. Mr Woolwine, Los Angeles, Cal.: Dear Sir: This letter will probably surprise you when you read it. I am taking this liberty to write you to make matters more easy for you. In the first place, I am Mr. Sands, although a friend of mine is writing this letter under my dictation. Mr. Woolwine, you need not look all over the world for me, for I am living right here in Los Angeles and am reading the papers every day concerning the Taylor murder. I will be frank with you, Mr Woolwine, I haventt had any peace of mind since the murder and I have come to the conclusion that the quicker this thing is settled the better off we will all be. Now, Mr. Woolwine, in the first place I did not murder Taylor, but I know who did it, but what assurance have I from you to know that you will accept my story? None. Therefore I want a guarantee from you that if I surrender myself into your hands and if I establish my innocence of the crime you will set me free. If you will do this, Mr. Woolwine,  I can untangle this murder mystery for you. You may answer me in any of the Los Angeles papers. Thank you. E. F. SANDS.   Mr. Woolwine 's reply follows: To Edward F. Sands, through the public press: I am in receipt of letter dated Feb. 14, 1922, postmarked Los Angeles, which, by its language, purports to have been dictated by you. I have no present means of knowing whether or not the letter is genuine, as I receive vast numbers of bogus communications, but I intend to treat it as genuine for the purpose of this communication. The letter states: "I did not murder Taylor but I know who did it," and inquires in substance that if you come forward and surrender yourself and establish your innocence of this crime whether or not I will set you free. The letter further states: " If you will do this, Mr. Woolwine, I can untangle this murder mystery for you. You may answer in any of the Los Angeles papers." In answer to this communication I wish to state that if Edward F. Sands will surrender himself to any of the police authorities or to me and establish to my satisfaction his innocence and give me information as to who committed this crime and untangle this murder mystery to my satisfaction as District Attorney of Los Angeles County, I will move a dismissal of the case of embezzlement now pending against him and set him free. THOMAS LEE WOOLWINE. Mr. Woolwine stated that the letter purporting to have come from Mr. Sands as postmarked Feb,. 15, but came to  his attention only today. He said that then he realized its importance in case it proved genuine, he  called a conference of polles detectives  and his own special investigators assigned to the case and that their unaulmous conclusion was that it could be  best to answer the letter, in chance  as genuine and might result in the  solving of the mystery.  Letters written by Taylor to women  friends are now sought. Attempts to  locate some letters written in reply  to the notes from to women in particular are said to have been met with  statements that the letters were "lost  or destroyed" soon after they were received. Investigators beileve, however, that a    few of his letters are in existence. Taylor's letters, it as stated, would  probably throw no new light on the  case, but possession of them is needed  to explain the letters already in District  Attorney Woolwine's safe. A new clue, which may put detectives  on the trail of the slayer. was revealed today by a Los Angeles pawnbroker, who reported that a few days before  Taylor was killed he sold a revolver  of the same calibre as that used in the  murder to a man the acted suspiclously. The name and address given  by the man then he made the purchase  were furnished by the lawnbroker, and  efforts are being made to trace him. According to the pawnbroker the man  was anxious when he bought the gun  and evaded answering questions concerning that he intended to, do with the  weapon. It became knoun today that Taylor  carried in a gold locket a picture of  Mabel Normand, a gift from her to him  inscribed "To My Dearest"  When  Taylor's body was examined after the  murder the locket as found appended  to a gold chain to vhich a gold watch,  to gold penelis, a gold knife and a  golden check protector were also attached.\
1922-02-19	One of the last interviews that William Desmond Taylor, noted director, permitted his press agent to send broadcast for publication dealt on a 'disease' called 'Filmphobia.' Taylor stated that it possesses dangerous possibilities which might easily wreck the future artistry of a director. 'Filmphobia,' said Mr. Taylor, 'comes on you after you have been directing pictures for a year or more. Its manifestations are that you gage everything by film standards; you lose your pleasure in other forms of art for their own sake. A picture director suffering from 'filmphobia,' and I speak from experience, reads a novel and sees in it only screen situations-- and misses the literary values. He sees a beautiful sunset--and immediately feels for the 'blue glass' which would translate those lambent colors into the grays, whites and black of the motion picture. The motion picture is a hard taskmaster. It is very apt to engross you to the exclusion of all other interests. When this happens you're suffering from 'filmphobia' and need a change of scenery. 'To cure himself of actual or incipient 'filmphobia' and to renew his contact with the other allied arts, every motion picture director should have at least three months away from the studio every year. And more and more they are doing it. Cecil B. De Mille is now in Europe; D. W. Griffith takes appreciable time between each effort.'
1922-02-19	Seek Taylor Murder Clue in Rival Studio;  Police Trace His Relations With Actress    LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 18. —The  hunt for the murderer of Willlam Desmond Taylor as taking more definite  form today vith several promising leads  being explored by the investigators. The  developments today were: 1. New evidence pointing to knowledge of the slaying by a man already  under suspicion. 2. The disappearance of a man who  answers the description of the prowler  seen at the Taylor bungalow on the  night of the murder. 3. Questioning of a group of movie  employes from one of the leading  studios by District Attorney Thomas  Lee Woolwine. The studio employes examined are from a company for which Taylor never  worked, and none of them has been  questioned before upon the murder. The  angle of the investigation upon vhich  they were questioned as their knowledge of the alleged relationship betveen Taylor and an actress of that company. The Sherifft's office was endeavoring  today to get something more on a suspect already trapped in one falsehood  and vho is believed to know the truth  about the murder. Important information about this man's past was found  by Deputy Sheriff Frank Dewar, and an  effort mill be made to break down his  first story. The man sought in another angle of  the investigation is a taxicab driver,  32 years old, who deserted the woman  the passed as his wife, and disappeared  the afternoon of the day on which Taylor was slain. The only article he took with him as his 38 calibre revolver,  a veapon similar to that which fired    the bullet that killed Taylor. In his room  were found three cartridges exactly like  the one that as fired at Taylor. They  are of a kind manufactured fifteen years  ago. The taxicab driver answered the description given by Mrs. Douglas MacLean of the man she saw leaving the  Taylor bungalow. In searching the missing man's room  detectives found a cap like that worn  by the man Mrs. MacLean saw. The  taxi driver usually wore a muffler, an  article that Mrs. MacLean noted on the  man seen by her. After he had been missing ten days  the driver went to his employer's office drew $14 that as due him and  again disappeared. He did not go again  to see the woman who passed as his  wife. It as she who reported his absence to the police. Descriptions of the  missing man mere sent broadcast by  the Police Department today. A Santa Ana rancher told the police  that on the night Of Jan. 30 he gave  a ride to two ex-service men, one of  whom threatened to get a certain Cap tain named Bill Taylor, who was a Captain in the British forces. LOS ANGELES. Feb. —8. —Mabel Normand, film actress, one of the last persons who saw Taylor before he was  shot, removed from her residence in  the Wilshire district to an unnamed address today. Friends said she was seeking seclusion to get some rest, made  necessary by the stress of repeated interviews concerning the case. Official investigators said Miss Normand had given satisfactory responses  to all questions put to her, and expressed no interest concerning her removal today.
1922-02-20	Blonde Killed Taylor, Says Psychoanalyst (New York)--'If a woman murdered William Desmond Taylor, she was a blonde,' says Dr. Andre Tridon, eminent psychoanalyst. Dr. Tridon, interviewed at his home today on aspects of the Taylor slaying, explained: 'The adrenal gland, a small gland located above the kidneys, is the physical center of the soul-differences between blondes and brunettes. In blondes this gland has a large center and a thin covering or cortex. The center of the gland makes excretions as a result of fear, and the covering makes an excretion of anger. The blonde has more fear and less anger than the brunette. It is a simple matter of physical fact. 'In the case of a man who is shot in the back, evidently from ambush or by an unseen assailant, it is almost dead certain that the woman who did it, if it was a woman, had blonde hair and a fair complexion. A brunette, being more violent in temperament, would have faced the man she killed in order to have the violent pleasure of letting him know she was doing it. 'This does not mean that blondes are less emotional than brunettes. There is no law, physical or psychological, to regulate the emotions. I mean only that blondes are less violent than brunettes. 'The dark peoples of the earth, moved by tremendous angers and passions, are the people who use knives and like to get a close quarters with their victims when they go out to kill. 'If a brunette had committed the Taylor murder she might have used a stiletto, or knife of some kind. At any rate, she would have faced him and shot while he realized what she was doing. The brunette demands actual contact with the object of her love or hate.'

1922-02-20	A search was being conducted Monday for the third man, who, according to the statement of George F. Arto, was talking with Mabel Normand's chauffeur and William Desmond Taylor's valet outside the Taylor bungalow the night of the murder. William Davis, chauffeur, insists there was no third man. Arto declares just as strongly that there was. HENRY PEAVEY, THE NEGRO VALET, SAYS HE IS NOT SURE THAT A MAN MIGHT HAVE STOPPED WHILE HE WAS TALKING TO DAVIS TO ASK FOR A MATCH OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT. Arto describes the third man as a rough looking customer. The sheriff's office attaches great importance to this point and it is believed that the mystery would be on the way to solution if this third man could be found and identified.
1922-02-20	America is supposedly a Democracy. It had a magnificent start, its laws being framed at a time when the world had emerged into a fair state of civilization--and yet, as Mr. Brisbane frequently points out in his masterly leading articles, the most appalling cases of injustice, which would disgrace a corrupt autocracy, seem to be continually occurring. One of the greatest is going on now. It is the hysterical, illogical attack upon the moving picture community, which has sprung forth as the aftermath of the tragic Taylor murder. My sense of 'cricket' won't let me remain silent about it any longer! I feel as I did once when I was a child, and hit a big man in the street with my little parasol, because he was beating a horse carrying a heavy load. My pen is only a tiny thing, but it is going to run on and write words to ask those of you who are good, just fellows and true citizens of a great country, to listen to me and then stop and think for yourselves. The moving picture industry is, I am told, the fifth largest in America. It employs countless carpenters, electricians, painters, plumbers, artists, draftsmen, architects, designers, writers and musicians. Probably the smallest number of its constituents are the actors and actresses--and only a fractional percentage of these are lurid figures who delight in scandalous excesses. But the whole community is being held up to the English speaking peoples of the earth as a rotten sore on the face of America! Can anything be more unjust and illogical? A mysterious murder is committed, and at once, like a flock of vultures, irresponsible reporters from the East swarm out to the Coast to get colorful news to telegraph back to their centers! They may individually be the kindest-hearted beings who would not hurt a fly--but they do not stop to think what harm they are doing to millions of their innocent countrymen and women when they spread hideous tales of dope fiends, parties and other horrors to ugly to speak of, giving the impression, culled from perhaps one isolated and probably hugely exaggerated case, that every actor and actress whom the public has grown to love and admire on the screen hides some grotesque vice in his or her palatial home, where orgies worse than those of Rome's decadence are supposed to occur nightly! NOW USE COMMON SENSE and ask yourselves, how could any business be done at all, how could pictures be made, how could work be accomplished, if even a tenth part of what is alleged were true? Dope fiends cannot come up to time every morning on the set at 9 o'clock and do a hard day's work; drunken women and men, putrid with vice, cannot register on the screen for all eyes to testify, as beautiful, fresh young boys and girls! Directors cannot, month after month and year after year, put over dramatic action and control large companies of people if they ware stupid and sodden with whisky. Use your intelligence, sharp-witted American public! And do not let scandalmongers get by with all this nonsense. You are not softies to be gulled by freakish exaggerations. Sift the thing down to probable facts, and your own intelligence will get at the truth. I am a stranger who has watched this cinema world for a year now. And they say that lookers-on see most of the game! It also is my habit to analyze and make psychological deductions, and I tell you that while it is perfectly true that there does exist a minute minority of vicious people in the business, there are hundreds and thousands of good, honest, hard-working men and women, girls and boys, children--and even animals; whose livelihood is threatened by the stamp which this injudicious attack upon the community at large may bring. So when next you--who read this--are scanning the papers of your home towns for fresh horrible details about the poor movie world, and nodding your heads over the imaginary Sodom and Gomorrah of Hollywood--try to remember that you are helping to take the bread out of the mouths of your fellow citizens, whose work has given you many hours of pleasure and relaxation and for which you should be grateful. And above all, you are lowering the prestige of your country in the eyes of the civilized world. Punish all offenders ruthlessly when offenses are proved against them. But do not stab an entire community in the back by spreading insidious scandal concerning it as a whole. I--Elinor Glyn--a stranger, who has always loved America, and realized its greatness, am appealing to you Americans to be just to your own kith and kin. Because justice and fair play are what the immortal Stars and Stripes stand for!

1922-02-21	The Taylor Case in Los Angeles Shows Incompetency of Police. The search--if one can call it a search--being made for the slayer of Motion Picture Director Taylor in Los Angeles is getting on the nerves of everybody, and the police should either produce the killer or turn the job of hunting for him over to competent persons. It seems as if every one who knew Taylor or could in any fashion be connected with the case has been interrogated at least a half dozen times. The police and the fame-seeking District Attorney of the California metropolis apparently have questioned persons who had no more to do with Taylor's murder than the residents of the Canary Islands. One Woolwine, District Attorney, made what he called an independent investigation, with a camera-man tagging him around and reporters in his following. Woolwine posed in the Taylor house with an assistant taking the part of the picture director--this being done to 'reconstruct the crime.' How would that help find the criminal? In their efforts the police and the Woolwine force have sent several reputable actresses into retirement, suffering from nervous prostration, and have cast some slight suspicion on a few persons who could not possibly kill another. The time has come for these Los Angeles sleuths and Woolwine and his actors to get off the job, and devote their time to whatever business may be at hand. Skilled detectives should take over the case and follow it to the end. Motion picture makers of Hollywood have raised a fund to hunt down Taylor's slayer, and they can put it to good use by dealing with a reputable detective agency and ignoring the incompetents of the police force and the District Attorney of Los Angeles.
1922-02-21	Last year when May Allison was going to New York she dropped into my house for lunch the day before she left. 'Going to buy a lot of clothes in New York?' I asked. 'Good heavens, no. I'm going to get a chance to wear some of those I've got. You never get a chance to show off your good clothes in Hollywood,' said the blonde screen star. And that's the sad truth. I've been in New York for just a month. I've been back in Hollywood a couple of days, and it's pretty dull out here, I tell you. After the bright lights of a big city, the curfew life we lead in the famous wicked film colony is a bit difficult to take. But it's a good place to rest up in, anyway. No cabarets. No place to dance nearer than six miles. An occasional party where the piece de resistance of the evening is likely to be the good old game of consequences. Listening to Wally Reid and Wanda Hawley play duets on the saxophone and the piano. Oh, well, I can get the papers and read what some of these writers that I never heard of, never saw in Hollywood, and who probably have never been there, have to say about it. Get a thrill out of that! Hollywood--the prize 'bad town' of the West! Why, Hangtown and Bodie in the good old days when shootin' was shootin' sound like a Seventh Day Adventist Sanitarium on Saturday compared with the things you read about Hollywood. Of course I don't know anything about it. I only live and work there. And yet--and yet--just before I came away, Mrs. Wallace Reid cried on my shoulder because she was so bored--sitting home every night in front of the fire with only an occasional dinner at the Hollywood Country Club to brighten her existence. First of all, there's our hotel life, of course. We have a very famous hotel in Hollywood. The Hollywood Hotel. A ramshackle old building which has been standing sedately on its corner for years and years and years. But it has housed more famous people than most architectural palaces. It has a nice family dining room where everybody has their own table and knows the waitresses by their first names. On Thursday nights they have dances in the lobby, after rolling up the carpets. I suppose to be in the modern style of Hollywood journalism I should call them 'dance orgies', but--I just can't. I haven't a great deal of regard for the truth in literature, but I have some inhibitions. The last Thursday night we drifted up there we found all the nice old ladies from Iowa and Kansas who come out for the winter sitting around in their best black satins, ready for the fray. Anita Stewart was there, shocking every one in the place almost to death by dancing every other dance with her husband, Rudy Cameron. Jack Dillon and his wife were tripping the light fantastic, and their little boy was allowed to stay up into 10 o'clock to watch. Lila Lee had on a frock of apple green that may have been immoral, but looked charming. With her was a good looking young millionaire to whom her engagement is often reported. They did sit out quite a few dances, they did. Mae Busch, startlingly vampish in black velvet, Marguerite de la Motte, May Allison--and we all went over to the drug store on the opposite corner and had an ice cream soda between dances. I tell you, it's a wild and wearing life. Yet there, in the very heart of this place which some parasites of the industry, seeking free advertising at the expense of the hand that fed them at least scrappily for some time say should be abolished, live and work some of the greatest literary geniuses of the age. Here, with alleged vice rampant about them, with wild women and dissolute men shrieking up and down the boulevard, so they tell us, here Gertrude Atherton wrote much of her latest novel. Here Sir Gilbert Parker lived and worked. Somerset Maughm had a little quiet room under the eves where he conceived and executed some of his brilliant comedies. Elinor Glyn completed her last book in her second floor suite. Rita Welman, Mary Roberts Rinehart, Rupert Hughes--all have lived in the Hollywood Hotel. I have visited most of them there, seen them hard at work. Must we forget that sort of thing utterly when we think of Hollywood? I went to a dinner party at Charlie Chaplin's house on the hill not very long ago. It was a real movie dinner party--most all celebrities: Charlie, Sam Goldwyn, Gouverneur Morris, Rupert Hughes and his wife and May Allison and Claire Windsor. Do you know what occupied three hours at the dinner table? I dare say some of our imported scribes would lead you to believe that they carried in the cocaine on the tea tables, that we spent the time in ribald jest and risque tales that would have made Boccacio blush to hear. Well as a matter of fact, Rupert Hughes and Charlie Chaplin launched at once into the most interesting theological discussion I have ever heard--Mr. Hughes, with his immense fund of information and historical statistics; Chaplin with his wonderful intellectual conception and imaginative impressionability. They discussed religion for three hours while we all listened spellbound. If you want to be fair about Hollywood, will you remember all this? While I was in New York I went to Delmonico's for supper after the theater with some friends. Upstairs, in a private banquet room, a group of railroad officials were having a party. There were about twenty of them, and they may have had doughnuts in their pockets, but I don't think so. Anyway, the pockets bulged considerably. During the evening they had a lot of girls-- dancing girls--up there and the noise was certainly indicative of a good, rousing old time. Wine, women and song seemed to be the order of the evening. If anybody pulled a party like that in the Hollywood Hotel or in any cafe in Hollywood the place would be raided, the neighbors would call out the fire department and the whole town would be shocked to death for a week. Polly Frederick is another screen star who gives a lot of parties. Last one she gave I lost $3.75. It was a terrible reckless evening for me. I mean, that's a lot to lose at penny ante poker, isn't it? Polly does like the wild life. After working all day, getting up at 6 in the morning for her ride through the hills, she's just all ready to carouse all night. And she does like a little poker game. For years Mary Pickford has lived the life of a recluse. There was nothing else for her to do. If the film people mingle with others, if they go into society, they can't possibly feel comfortable. I went to a reception one night with Bebe Daniels--it was a wedding reception and the bride was an old friend of ours. We had known her in our schooldays before we became residents of the horrible center of vice, Hollywood. Poor old Bebe. She was stared at, talked about, eyed, talked to in the most insane manner I have ever heard in my life, until at last she grasped my arm and gasped, 'For heaven's sake, let's get out of this. I feel like an animal in the Zoo.' Yet those were good, kindly, well-behaved folk of the social strata. There is another thing that we face in Hollywood. The hangers-on. And they are not all poor ones, by any means. The worst place in Hollywood last year belonged to the good-fellow husband of a rich woman, whose place offered every inducement possible for the entertainment of guests. Swimming pool, motors, tennis court, servants, costly food and plenty of good liquor were thrown out as bait for the film folk, with whom it was his chief ambition in life to consort. A group of rich young men, attracted by the pretty faces of the film stars, hang about on the fringe of the colony, delighting to mingle on free and friendly terms with the possessors of such famous names and by their actions bringing more censure--and more justified censure--on the industry than any of those who get a pay envelope across the studio counter.
1922-02-21	WOMAN OFFERS CLUE IN TAYLOR MYSTERY Tells of Director's Quarrel With Another Woman a Few Days Before His Death. HAD WORRIED ABOUT IT Name of New Witness Is kept Secret Denial That Negro Valet Has "Confessed."   Special to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb, 20 .A woman who declares she knows of a bitter quarrel between another woman and William Desmond Taylor a few days before he was murdered was summoned to the District Attorney's office today to tell her story, which was expected to furnish new clues. Precautions were taken to keep the woman witness's identity secret, as she informed Deputy Disstrict Attorney W. C. Doran that she would not appear unless she was assured that her name would not appear in  connection with the investigation. The woman told Doran that she knew both Taylor and the other woman. The quarrel, she said, occurred at Taylor's home and worried the director considerably. Wild reports that Henry Peavey, Taylor's valet, had "confessed" in Los Angeles, naming a prominent motion picture actress as the slayer, were circulated in Chicago today, according to dispatches from that city. The reports  that Peavey or any one else had "confessed " were denied by Captain of Detectives Adams and others investigating the murder. Police detectives were searching today for a negro drug addict who, they said, would be arrested on sight in connection with the investigation. Circumstances throwing suspicion on the negro, the officers said, must be explained by him before he can be eliminated as the possible slayer. The detectives explained that the negro for whom they were searching was not Henry Peavey. Tayor's valet-cook, who reports to the officers daily Investigators today endeavored to clear the discrepancies in the stories of Peavey and William Davis, chauffeur for Mabel Normand, on one hand, and George C. Arto, motion picture mechanic, on the other. Arto asserts that he saw a third man with Peavey and Davis in front of the Taylor home shortly before the murder, while Peavey and Davis declare they were alone. "There were three men," Arto said. "One was a chauffeur at the wheel of an automobile, which I suppose was Miss Norman's. On the sidewalk near  the car were two men, Peavey and another. I recognized Peavey as I had seen him a number of times previously. The third man was dark complexioned and wore a cap. As I passed I heard the name 'Taylor' spoken two or three times." Both Peavey and Davis maintain they were alone and that Arto must be mistaken. Mabel Normand was today in strict seclusion at her new home, 1,159 Foothill Boulevard, Altabena, where she moved from her West Seventh Street apartment last Friday night. Four guards have been stationed on the grounds of  the Altabena house to prevent callers from getting to the door without first stating their business.\
1922-02-22	Astounding charges that Henry Peavey, negro servant of William D. Taylor, murdered motion-picture director, was held prisoner for nearly twelve hours in the office of the Los Angeles Examiner, and that Examiner reporters late at night took Peavey to the tomb of Taylor, where they attempted to bully and terrorize him by confronting him with a 'ghost,' were made last night by Dist.-Atty. Woolwine, who characterized the Examiner's actions as 'presumptuous, dangerous and dastardly.' The energetic denunciation of Examiner tactics by Mr. Woolwine followed a long conference between the District Attorney and William F. Eldridge, managing editor of the Examiner, who went to Mr. Woolwine's office on the eleventh floor of the Hall of Records. Mr. Eldridge was preceded in the District Attorney's office by Peavey, who related in detail the asserted offenses of the Examiner's representatives. Twelve typewritten pages comprised Peavey's statement to the District Attorney. He said that two men came to his room before noon last Sunday and asked him to come out. 'I am not doing any talking to newspaper reporters'--Peavey said he informed the pair. One of the men, he said, replied: 'Newspaper reporters? We are not newspaper reporters; we are officers from New York and we have authority to come down here and get you and have you go over your statements, and we want you to go down to the Examiner office and answer one question.' Peavey said that he asked them to tell him what question he was to be asked, but that they said they did not know, adding, he said, 'there's $1000 in it for you.' Instead of taking him direct to the Examiner office, however, he said, one of the men announced, 'It is a beautiful day and we will drive around for awhile.' He says he got into an automobile with the men and was driven through Hollywood and through the cemetery where Mr. Taylor's body lies. Returning, he says, the automobile picked up another man at the Alexandria and then proceeded to the Examiner office. Upon arriving there, according to Peavey, 'we went in and a gentleman asked me what movie man it was in Hollywood that was paying me to keep my mouth shut, and I looked at him and said, 'Nobody has ever given me a penny for anything excepting this gentleman here, who gave me $10.' ' This money, Peavey said, was handed to him during his automobile ride Sunday afternoon. Peavey told the District Attorney that he was kept waiting for some time in the Examiner office and that he asked to be permitted to get something to eat, whereupon, he stated, one of the men said, 'No, we will send out and buy you some.' He described the supper brought into the Examiner for him and said that after further questioning he was taken to Hollywood by the three Examiner reporters. He said the Examiner men referred several times to a spiritualist who would, according to his story of their assertions, cause him to talk with Mr. Taylor's spirit. His remarkable story of the appearance of the Examiner's 'ghost' and the fiasco that ensued is taken from the transcript of his testimony on file in Mr. Woolwine's office. 'They drove into the cemetery and said, 'Gee; goodness! it makes me nervous to drive into a cemetery at night. How do you feel, Henry?' I replied, 'It doesn't bother me.' They drove up to the vault where Mr. Taylor was lying. They said, 'Turn quick.' They turned the car and all the lights went out to make it dark. 'I got out of the car and walked over to the vault and just as I got there a man walked out from behind the vault with a white sheet over him and they said, 'Look! look! look! there is Taylor!'[1] 'I stood and looked at him and he commenced to make some funny noises and dropped down and got me around the feet and commenced groaning. They kept trying to make me run, and I wouldn't run, and said: ' 'What in the hell are you guys trying to make out of me anyway, a fool?' ' Peavey related that a further attempt to intimidate him was made by the Examiner last night, but that he paid no attention to his asserted tormentors. Mr. Woolwine's statement denouncing the Examiner follows: 'Henry Peavey, the negro servant of William D. Taylor, deceased, who has shown a very deep and genuine grief over the murder of Mr. Taylor, and who has at all times given the authorities every assistance in his power in their effort to unravel the mystery of the murder, and who has held himself ready to respond to repeated calls by the officers for such information as he could give, was taken from his room by a pair of conscienceless blackguards who represented themselves to be officers of the law, and held a prisoner from noon until about midnight on last Sunday. During this imprisonment, he was subjected to the most outrageous treatment. He was held for hours in the office of the Los Angeles Examiner, not even being permitted to leave the premises to get necessary food when he became hungry. 'To add to the unspeakable injustice of this high-handed procedure, he was conveyed to the cemetery by night by these two scoundrels, who first took him from his room, and another rascal who joined them, was taken to the tomb of his former employer and every effort made to bully and terrorize him. 'It should be remembered that this man, Peavey, had been subjected to the most searching examination, not only by the District Attorney's office, but by the skilled officers of the Los Angeles Police Department of many years' experience in the detection of crime. He has at all times shown the utmost anxiety and eagerness in his effort to render to the duly constituted authorities every assistance possible. Is is regrettable that the District Attorney has no jurisdiction over the offense committed by these miscreants for the false imprisonment of this witness. I have not been able as yet to ascertain their names, but if I knew them, and had such jurisdiction, they would be in jail tonight. 'It seems that this witness's only offense is that he is a simple-minded colored man, who has little knowledge of his real rights as an American citizen and can neither read nor write. This presumptuous, dangerous and dastardly interference by a newspaper with the orderly course of procedure by the duly constituted authorities, is calculated to and does so terrorize good and well-meaning people that they, for their own protection, keep secret important facts that might lead to the discovery to the perpetrators of foul crimes. Such acts are a positive menace to the people at large. 'I feel it my duty as District Attorney of Los Angeles County, to expose such vile, cowardly and unlawful practices, for the perpetrators of which every decent citizen should feel a most supreme and utter contempt.'
1922-02-22	An amplified statement secured yesterday by The Examiner from George F. Arto, motion picture writer, gives new facts which tend to change the whole theory of the crime as to its time element. Arto, it will be recalled, passed front of the Taylor house on the night of the murder and, as he states, saw Peavey standing on the sidewalk talking to a man of swarthy complexion--a rough looking character. This was at approximately 7 o'clock. HIS MEMORY REFRESHED BY CIRCUMSTANCES TO WHICH HIS ATTENTION HAD BEEN CALLED SINCE GIVING HIS FIRST STATEMENT, HE REMEMBERED YESTERDAY THAT HE RETURNED TO THE BUNGALOW COURT AT 7:45 O'CLOCK. HE IS POSITIVE OF THIS, HE SAID, AS HE PHONED A YOUNG WOMAN WHO LIVES NEAR THE TAYLOR BUNGALOW, ON WHOM HE WAS CALLING. HE TOLD HER IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT HE WOULD BE OVER IN FIVE MINUTES AND, LOOKING AT HIS WATCH, HE FOUND THE TIME TO BE 7:40. HE IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO WALK FROM HIS HOME AT 220 SOUTH BONNIE BRAE STREET. HE REACHED A POINT IN FRONT OF TAYLOR'S HOUSE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES. 'AT THAT TIME,' HE SAID, 'I SAW NO ONE AROUND. MISS NORMAND'S CAR HAD GONE, AND PEAVEY WAS NOT IN SIGHT.' HE WENT TO THE HOUSE OF THE YOUNG WOMAN, AND SAT IN THE FRONT ROOM NEXT TO THE WINDOW UNTIL ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER EIGHT. 'DURING THAT TIME,' HE DECLARED, 'I HEARD NO SHOT AND AM POSITIVE THAT I WOULD HAVE HEARD A SHOT BEEN FIRED.' Arto is familiar with firearms, having tested guns for the Savage Arms Company and would be able, he asserts, to distinguish a pistol shot from the backfire of automobiles. As close to the scene of the crime as was either Mrs. MacLean or her maid, Christina Jewett, and in a better position to hear and observe, Arto nevertheless was not attracted by any unusual noises. Hence, it is now believed possible that the murder may have been committed either before or after the time fixed by Mrs. MacLean. And District Attorney Woolwine yesterday admitted the likelihood that the man seen by Mrs. MacLean leaving Taylor's front door was Howard Fellows, the film director's chauffeur.
1922-02-22	My mental picture of Hollywood is getting to the place where I have to sit down and do a lot of remembering to be sure I'm right. When I read about the 'wild tribe of Hollywood' now under investigation I begin to sing South Sea Island lullabies and see exotic panoramas of huts in the wilderness, of groups of people living in cellar dives which the sunlight never reaches, of fantastic settings like those I used to see in the old San Francisco Chinatown. And I say to myself: 'Hollywood, my Hollywood; can you have been deceiving me all these years? Under that bright and charming exterior that I know so well, in that soul that I've been on such darn good terms with for all these years--are you really a den of iniquity?' Then I positively get the giggles. Why, it'll probably surprise you a lot to know that we actually have homes in Hollywood. Real homes. Where people live, with their kids, and have problems about heating the house, and keeping the lawn watered, and getting a cook that will stay. Florence Vidor, for instance, has a new home that would deceive the most hectic of our smut-seeking sleuths. You'd never dream it was anything but the charmingly kept, tasteful home of a southern lady. Last time I was there Florence and I were sitting in her sitting-room, satisfying our evil passions with some after-luncheon mints. Mammy, the Negro servant whom Florence brought from her home in Texas, had little Suzanne Vidor, Florence's 4-year-old daughter, down in the kitchen with hear, and when she went out to answer the telephone she told Suzanne to watch the coffee. In a minute Suzanne came dashing in and called at the top of her small voice, 'Mamma, mamma, come quick. The coffee is frowing up all over the stove.' Just tell that one the next time you want to give your friends an example of the risque jokes we tell in Hollywood. I don't think you should visit the Milton Sills home, however. It's pretty trying work, talking with Mr. and Mrs. Sills. Maybe it wouldn't exactly shock you, but it would give you an awful mental kick. They talk about the effect climate has had on the development of different races of the earth and the age of the various astronomical suns as judged by the differences in their color. Of course, Milton used to be a college professor, and that may have saved him from the vile clutches of the Hollywood monster. As to the Charles Rays--I'll hardly be able to convince you about them. The Rays' home is quite the most beautiful place I have been in. They spent more than two years selecting the furniture and the wall drapes and the works of art that fill it. They own some delicious pictures and Mrs. Ray spends about half her time between her voice and piano lessons--pretty swift pace she keeps up, too. Their butler is the best I've ever seen, in or out of the Sunday supplements. Mrs. Ray also is a very fine needle-woman. Really, being in the movies, I don't see how they move in the social set they do out there. They are quite 'in' now--Mrs. Ray is on the committee of the Children's Hospital, with all the blue blood of the town. Gets her name in the society column and everything. Of course, when I think of Lois Wilson I have just one desire in the world. To see her face when she reads what kind of a place she really lives in. Only, of course, Lois won't know what it's all about. Last summer Lois' mother and sister went over to Catalina for a few weeks and left Lois and her father alone in their white plaster house in the foothills. Lois and her father did their own cooking and used to be real devilish and toss a coin to see who washed the dishes. I went up one morning to get Lois to go down to the beach and go swimming with me. All over the house--pasted on Lois' dressing mirror, on the lamp shade, on the front door, pinned on the pillow covers--was this legend in bold, black type. 'Lois, don't forget to feed the bird.' So the worst you can say about Lois is that maybe she hasn't a very good memory. The Jack Holts are another family that--really, all joking aside, I don't believe in any town, anywhere in the country, you'll find another home like the Holts. They have three kiddies, and honestly (I hope they won't see this story) Jack just literally bores you to death telling you about them. I think they must have meant Jack Holt when they told that story about somebody liking to play horse. Because Jack uses the big blue drawing room chiefly as a race course around which he crawls on all fours with Jack Jr.-- who's getting close to his third birthday--on his back. William de Mille and his wife, Ann--the daughter, by the way of Single Tax George--live in a big old brown house, all books and a bit shabby inside. Once a week William has a class of devotees who come up there for a lecture on political economy, and Bill's idea of the way to spend all the money he makes in the movies is to conduct private political and advertising campaigns for the legislative movements he believes in. Last year he spent a small fortune advocating one such bill. Oh yes--I mustn't forget this one. Conrad Nagel is an usher in one of the biggest churches on Hollywood boulevard. You can see him there twice on Sunday, wearing a frock coat and a sweet smile. The Nagels have a baby daughter a year and a half old. Of course they can return a terrible indictment against Lila Lee--and Bebe Daniels. Lila lives at home with her mother and sister, Bebe has just bought a big house in the exclusive West Adams district, where she reigns over a bevy of grandmother, mother, aunts and such like.
1922-02-22	AGAIN SEEK WOMAN IN TAYLOR KILLING Under Sheriff Returns to Theory That Jealousy Was Motive of Murder. OTHER CLUES FOLLOWED Police Seek for Questioning a Negro Who Had been at the Taylor Home With His Valet.   Special to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 21. Holding tenaciously to the theory that a woman killed William Desmond Taylor, slain film director. Under Sheriff Biscailuz today decided to question again numerous witnesses who had been summoned before. One of the first was a chauffeur who has been twice questioned by District Attorney Woolwine. It was considered a possibility that the woman who employs the chauffeur would be questioned again in connection with Biscailuz's inquiry. Officers also took up the trall of a negro named Anderson, sought for questioning. Anderson was injected into the case by Henry Peavey, Taylor's negro valet-cook. Peavey said that he met Anderson, whom he had known in St. Louis, on the street near Taylor 's home about two weeks before the murder. Anderson told Peavey he was out of work and Peavey took him to the Taylor home, where he telephoned to a friend of Taylor 's who needed a servant. Anderson obtained this place. but a week before Taylor was slain he again appeared at the Taylor home and told Peavey he had quit. "Anderson stayed at the house with me for several hours and then left. I haven 't seen him since," Peavey said. From Peavey the detectives learned that Anderson, because of his visits there, was well acquainted with Taylor's home.   Information concerning a bank account of Taylor's in New York, which was reported to Publie Administrator Bryson yesterday, was awaited today. The Guaranty Trust Company of New York informed Bryson that Taylor had deposited $7,811.52 in this bank in the Fall of 1919. The money was deposited in two instalments, one of $3,300 on Aug. 20, 1919, and the other of $4,511.52 on Oct. 7. As the account now stands there is only $18.96 to Taylor's credit. No cancelled checks showing what use of the money he withdrew from the New  York bank were found in Taylor's effects and the trust company was asked to make a full accounting immediately. The discovery of this bank account revived interest in the theory that Taylor was slain by blackmailers. It was suggested that he may have withdrawn the money to give to some one whom he feared. An examination of Taylor's account at the First National Bank in Los Angeles had disclosed that he withdrew $4,000 under the head of "cash" on one occasion. Detectives sought to learn what became of this money. Daniel O'Shea, the taxicab driver who was brought into the case because he disappeared mysteriously on the night of the murder, was completely eliminated in the investigation after being questioned at the District Attorney's office. O'Shea established a complete alibi. How Taylor sent telegrams each night to one of the two film actresses who were his most intimate women friends while she was away from Los Angeles, was told by Peavey in a new statement concerning Taylor's life shortly before he was slain. "You can' t tell me Mr. Taylor wasn't in love with this lady." Peavey said. "Why, I've seen him sit down to read and then get up and take a photograph of her and put it near him and gaze at it while he smoked. Some time ago she was in the East and every night he wrote her a telegram which I took to the office to be sent. "One night I saw her take her pictures from the wall in Mr. Taylor's house and begin cutting them up with a pair of sclssors. Mr. Taylor said: 'What's the idea?' She said:  'I guess I can cut up my own pictures if I want to.'   "Once I saw him take her in his arms and she put her arms around him and they kissed each other." Mabel Normand has recovered sufficiently from her illness, brought on by grief over the murder, to begin work on her new picture, "Susanna," according to reports at the Altadena house, where she went into seclusion last week. Al Herman, Miss Normand's director. stateed that she will start work on the picture immediately. A copy of a cablegram sent to Taylor in London by "Mabel " from Los Angeles June 26, 1921, has been found in his effects. It read: " Dearest Bill: Powder box wonderful. Sick abed pleurisy nine days. Feel better. Miss you dreadfully. All love. Mabel." CONCORD, N. C., Feb, 21. Chief of Police Talbert arrested a man here tonight suspected of being Edward F. Sands, who is wanted in connection with the killing of William Desmond Taylor. the motion picture director, in California. The man held here is said to fit closely the description of Sands.

DETROIT, Mich., Feb, 21.A prisoner here in the Wayne County jail told officials tonight he knew the identity of the slayer of William Desmond Taylor, motion picture director. Sheriff Irving J. Coffin, to whom many purported details of the murder were related, said that until word comes from Los Angeles he could not divulge the prisoner's name or the nature of his admissions.
1922-02-23	Believers in spiritual communication, delvers into the occult, and those who strive to penetrate into the realm of the unseen will be thrilled by an announcement received from Boston today that the victim of the mysterious film murder has been in verbal contact with an earthly human and that some of the purported conversation centered on the mysterious slayer. The announcement came to Los Angeles in a remarkable letter. News of the efforts of local psychics to communicate with Taylor reached a woman in Boston, and she, in her letter, states that previous to her receipt of this information she had conversed with the director's spirit. This Boston medium, who claims to discourse with spirits without the aid of the familiar 'trance' says: 'I was reared by parents of spiritualistic tendencies, so I am a natural believer in those things spiritual. I get in touch with spirits that have passed on easily, without trances. 'I have already 'had touch' with this man Taylor or Tanner. I asked him which named he preferred and he answered, 'Never mind, dear lady.' 'Then I asked him, 'Who did the killing? Do you know?' He answered, 'Of course I know. But I will not tell. Perhaps I am much to blame.' 'I asked him why he came to me and the answer was: 'I seek only rest and peace. I find it near a stranger.' 'I asked him, 'Can you show yourself to me?' and he answered, 'No, for I am naked. I am repenting.' 'I inquired if there were other souls who were not naked and he answered that some come wrapped in a glory of light as a garment. 'But I have no garment.' ' 'Why not go to those of shining aura?' I inquired and the answer was, 'Not now, presently. O, let me live awhile yet with those that walk in the flesh.' ' Local psychics are communicating further with the Boston woman, with a view to possible further alleged manifestations of Taylor's spirit.

The trio went into the bungalow and  returned in a few moments, vhereupon  he drove them avay, the prisoner added, and continued that the plot to kill  Taylor was conceived in a "hop joint" in Los Angeles. He is quoted by the  Sheriff as saying he got the $900 on his  return to the "hop joint," after the  Taylor slaying, vith the men and the  woman. He did not know the motive  for the murder and did not know  whether the men and the woman were  paid for their part in it. He gave to  Sheriff Coffin the names of the trio. Fields also told the Sheriff the alleged    hiding place of the revolver with which  the murder was committed.

The police were unable to  find the pistol where Fields said it was. District Attorney Woolwine, in a statement tonight, assailed local newspaper  men who tried to scare a story out of  Henry Peavey, Taylor's negro valet. The District Attorney said :  "He was subjected to the most outrageous treatment. He was held for  hours in the office of The Los Angeles  Examiner. He was conveyed to the  cemetery at midnight by these two  scoundrels and another rascal who  joined them; was taken to the tomb of  his former employer and every efforts  made to terrorize him."

1922-02-25	SAYS FILM ACTRESS HAD TAYLOR KILLED   Harry M. Fields, Held in Detroit,  Declares She Was One of  Four to Plot Crime. CHECKING UP ON HIS STORY Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs Plan to  Have Cashier Who Changed  $1,000 Bill Identify Him.   DETROIT. Feb. 24 —A motion-picture  actress who ranks high in the profession as one of the four persons who  plotted the murder of Willlam Desmond  Taylor, film director, according to the  story of Harry M. Fields, under arrest  here, Sheriff Irving J. Coffin of Wayne  County announced late today. The Sheriff withheld the woman's identity. It was stated also that additional evidence had been uncovered here which  served to strengthen Fields's story of  his knowledge of the crime. A search  of his effects disclosed receipts showing  he was in Los Angeles late in January. Among these was a rent receipt for a  place in Venice, Cal., where Fields has  maintained the details of Taylor's staying were arranged. Fields, according to the Sheriff, stated  that the actress was not present when  Taylor was shot and reiterated that the  only participants at the scene of the  crime were the three he describes as  Wong Lee, a Chinese, who did the shooting. Johnny Clark, a white man, and a  Jennie Moore, all of vhom mere hired  to take their parts in the murder. Authorities here have been unable to  locate a bank book which Fields is said  to have had in his possession at the time  of his arrest, bearing the name of "Sam  Coplin," an alleged allas, shoving a  deposit of $180 in Chicago, on Feb. 2,  the day after the Taylor murder. Fields has, hovever, offered the explanation that he maintained the account in Chicago for the benefit of his  daughter and made deposits by mail,  through a friend. Officers point out that  this would clear up the issue that was  raised by the supposed presence of  the suspect in Chicago the day after  he claims to have been in Los Angeles. Californla authorities have been made  acquainted with the new developments.   Special to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES. Cal., Feb. 24.— While  testing the "confession", of Harry M. Fields, who is in jail at Detroit. Disstrict Attorney Woolwine began an investigation today of the story that  William Desmend Taylor fought a  "dope" gang to save a woman. a struggle which, according to the  latest theory in the case, resulted in the  murder. Woolwine acted after the announcement by Assistant United States  District Attorney Tom Green that Taylor had appealed for and obained the  aid of Federal officers in his fight on the   "narcotic ring." Detectives King and Winn visited  Green at his office and obtained from  him the complete details of how Taylor  forced with Federal officers to rescue  the woman from the  "dope" peddiers. King and Winn were then immediately  detailed to make a full investigation. Deputy Sheriffs made efforts to identify Fields as the man who changed a  $1,000 bill at the Hellman All Night and  Day Bank, Sixth and Main Streets, on  the morning of Feb. 2, the day after the  murder. Fields claimed he was paid  $1,000 for having driven Wong Lee, vith  a woman known as Jennie Moore and a  man known as Johnny Clarke, to and  from the scene of the murder. L. D. Seat, a teller at the bank, told  the officers that he changed a $1,000 bill for a man who acted suspiciously on the  morning of Feb. 2. An effort mill now be made to have the cashier identify  Fields as the man the changed the    $1,000. If this is done it could  strengthen his story of the crime. During the night, William Davis,  chauffeur for Mabel Normand, was  questioned again by Chief Deputy  Sheriff Al Manning and Deputy Sheriff Joe Nolan. Davis appeared at the  Sheriff's office by appointment and  left with Manning and Nolan. No  hint as given of the purpose of the  questioning of the chauffeur, who had  already  been questioned time and  again by Woolwine and the detectives  working on the case. Miss Mabel Normand, who was the  last known person to see Taylor alive,  was reported today to be recoverlng  from a serious attack of influenza at  Altadena, where she went to rest. Her  parents arrived from New York a few days ago and joined her there.
1922-02-26	Lauding to the skies Hollywood and its motion-picture industry in his Los Angeles papers and reviling them in his Eastern sheets as a pesthole of iniquity and as the dregs and offscourings of the lowest type of social criminals, William Randolph Hearst has reached new heights of journalistic hypocrisy--for revenue only. No praise is too fulsome or extravagant for Heart's LOS ANGELES EXAMINER to heap upon the film industry in Los Angeles, its home. No insults are too gross or baseless to hurl at that same Los Angeles industry in Hearst's CHICAGO AMERICAN and his dozen-odd other eastern papers. The damage done to Los Angeles by the circulation of these unfounded libels is past computation. Nor has Hearst the excuse that his eastern reports are prepared at a distance by writers not in a position to get the facts. These reports have every one been written by Hearst employees in Los Angeles working out of the Los Angeles Examiner building and using the Hearst wires from this city. That they are recognized as unbridled fabrications is proven by the fact that the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER, which has to live here, has printed not a line of them.
1922-02-26	Social Requirements If one is invited to dine or to luncheon, or to tea outside the industry one is expected to have at least one original idea on who murdered Taylor. At first it was rather a shock to have someone say: 'Oh come, you know all the inside dope, tell me.' Not having had any previous experience with unraveling murder mysteries and not being a graduate of a Sherlock Holmes school it was something of a blow to be prepared to given an explanation of who killed the most talked of man in the country. To our earnest, 'Really I did not know Mr. Taylor. I have no idea who could have killed him,' we have been met with suspicious looks and a manner as if we were concealing some of the inside facts. But every one else in the motion picture industry has had the same experience. To be connected with motion pictures in any way is enough to make the layman believe one should know more than State's Attorney Woolwine and the men who are unraveling this murder mystery.
1922-02-26	SEEK TAYLOR CLUE IN SAN FRANCISCO Los Angeles Detective is Sent to Trace Telephone Call on Right of the Murder. HOPES FOR DEVELOPMENTS Fields Now Says Actress Waved Bag of Candy as Signal for the Shooting.   Special to The New York Times. LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25 ".-A new tail which is considered likely to develop evidence of the slayer of William Desmond Taylor was taken To today, when Police Detective Herman Cline, working under District Attorney Woolwine 's direction. was reported to be in San Franciseoo is tracing a telephone message sent by a woman on the night of the murder. The woman is said to have telephoned from Loss Angeles to a friend at a San Francisco hotel a few hours after the slaying, saying that she was "in trouble" and needed help immediately. A record of the message is reported to have been found several days ago by Cline and others at the offices of the telephone company here. According to the information obtained by Cline, the message was sent to the St. Francis Hotel. Cline 's mission was plainly for the purpose of questioning hotel employes and telephone operators in the northern City. If Cline confirms the report that the woman sent the message saying she was " in trouble," and needed help shortly after Taylor was slain. Woolwine will have evidence, it is believed, that will bring startling developments in his investigation. The woman said to have sent the message is one of the witnesses already questioned in the investigation by the District Attorney. Miss Mabel Normand, whose physicians say she is ill with infiuenza at her temporary home in Altadena, was reported to be " somewhat improved" in condition today. The physicians said that while her condition is not dangerous, it demands constant care and attention, and that she has yet a trying period before her recovery They discounted reports from the Mack Sennett Studios that Miss Normand has only a "slight cold," and declared that her condition requires absolute rest and quiet. While the story told by Harry M. Fields in Detroit has practically been discarded because of its improbabilities. the theory that Taylor was slain by "done" peddlers, whom he fought to save a woman, is still getting serious consideration in the investigation. Detectives King and Winn reported today to Woolwine after investigating to learn the history of Taylor 's fight against the narcctie gang. Their investigation was made on the strength of the statement by Assistant united States Attorney Green that Taylor had appealed for and obtained the aid of, Federal officersin fighting the gang eighteen months ago, mentioning that he was endeavoring to save a woman in whom he was " deeply interested,” and who, he said, was paying as high as $2,000 a month to the peddlers. The detectives are believed to have is established as true the report that Tayfor administered a severe beating to one is of the peddlers several months ago, kicking him out of his house.   Says Developments Are Likely. SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Feb, 28.Herman Cline, Los Angeles police detective sergeant, conferred today with Captain of Detectives Duncan Matheson regarding certain phases of the William Desmond Taylor murder case that have come to light in this city Cline told Captain Matheson that he was in San Francisco " under sealed orders " and expected further advices from his surperiors. Police Detective Henry Kalmbach was  detailed to assist Cline in his investigations here and the two left the Hall of justice together. Matheson announced that " developments were like ly. DETROIT Mich., Feb. 25-Asserting he had previously given fictitious names in identifying the persons he claimed were implicated in the murder of William Desmond Taylor Loss Angeles film director Harry M. Fields, held here a awaitingesentence for forgery told authorities today he would furnish information that would clear up the crimes if promised partial immunity by the California officials. "I expect to do a prison stretch for my part in this mess, but I dont want  to hang," Fields was quoted as saying. Fields was subjected today to another cross-examination by Lieutenants of Dolive Marlin and Smith and Sheriff trying J. Coffin, and made two changes in his story of the shooting of Taylor, but continued to insist he dreve the care used by the slayers and was paid $1,000. He said today, according to the investigators, that a prominent motion) picture actress, who he said was one of the quartet that planned the killing, preceded the other three participants to the Taylor home with the understanding that she was to give the signal when the opportune moment arrived to do the shooting and escape. When the care containing the Chinese or is the white man and woman, who he said were the others implieated, arrived at the Taylor bungalow Fields is said to have declared that the actress emerge day is from the house and, standing in the shadow of the porch, waved a Bag of is candy. The two men immediately left is the automobile and a few seconds later Fields heard a shot, according to his is purported statement. The men stepped from a window of the house and reI entered the care, the investigators said he told them. In the meanwhile, the actress who had given the signal, disappeared. Fields was previously said to have day officers that the actress implicated in the killing was not at the scene. After, the shooting Fields, it is claimed, said he drove back to the other three and received his money He left Los Angeles that night, officers said he told them, although he prewiously had asserted he stayed there est two days. When Fields was questioned as to his reason for giving fictious names in describing the killing, officers said he told them " they were pressing me hard for names and I had to say something." Fields is to be sentenced here next week on the forgery charge to which he recently pleaded guilty.
1922-02-27	Harry M. Fields, the man under arrest in Detroit and exploited in the last few days as one of the slayers of Taylor, yesterday took his place in the 'confession hall of defame.' Fields was finally eliminated by dispatches from Indianapolis stating that Guy Broughton, Federal narcotic agent there, arrested Fields in Buffalo, N.Y., February 2, the day after Taylor was killed, and turned him over to the Detroit police. Fields was taken into custody on a drug-peddling charge. The Federal officers expressed an opinion that Fields indulged in a little too much of his own merchandise.
1922-02-27	It was revealed yesterday that Detective Sergeant Tom Ziegler, first officer to arrive at the scene of the crime, found among Taylor's effects several checks bearing the director's signature and not filled out and one made to Edward F. Sands for $950. This, it is believed, was a forgery. The others were to be used by Sands during Taylor's absence in Europe for payment of household bills. The $950 check was never cashed. The conclusion is that Sands was trying his hand at forgery. Although the entire country has been circularized for this man, who is believed by many of the officers to be the murderer, no trace of him has been found. Reports that he is in Mexico have never been verified. .....$1000 REWARD will be paid by The Examiner for information furnished exclusively to this office that will lead to the arrest and conviction of the slayer of William Desmond Taylor. $500 will be paid by The Examiner for exclusive information as to the whereabouts of Edward F. Sands. Call City Editor of Examiner, Pico 4000.
1922-02-27	REVERT TO SANDS IN TAYLOR MURDER Los Angeles Investigators, Other Clues Failing, Turn to him for Solution. TO PUSH NATIONWIDE HUNT Bulletin With Photograph and Full Description Will Be sent Throughout Country.   Los ANGELES, Cal., Feb, 2 .-With the failing of the other ciues in the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery large police bulletins with a deseription of Edward F. Sands, former employe of Taylor will be sent throughout the country in the hope that his arrest, which has been sought since the slaying, may aid in solving the film director 's murder. Detective Sergeant Herman Cline, returning late today from San Francisco, declared his mission had been futile. The supposed clue on which he was working was among the last, and the failure of it to reveal anything brought renewed determination to find Sands, either to eliminate him from the case or to solve the crime. One of the original investigators in the case said tonight that the countrywide distribution of bulletins earrying a complete description of Sands and his photograph will be pressed today The Los Angeles Police Department has issued a special bulletin concerning Sands, and the police plan to send this information to every Police Department in the country. Mr. Cline 's mission to San Francisco was to check up a telephone call supposed to have been sent from Los Angeles to San Francisco on the night of the slaying and before the body was discovered. The woman sending this call has come to the attention of the authorities and she was reported to have told her San Francisco friend that she was " in trouble." A check of the calls recorded in Los Angeles was made by Charles A. Jones, former Chief of Police, who has been retained by motion picture interests to said in the case. Mr. Cline checked the San Francisco end. He visited not only the hotel at which the friend was reported to have been staying, but also all the other prominent hotels. He found nothing, he said. that will in any way aid the investigation. Sheriff deputies have worked along other clues involving telegrams, it became known today. They made public the following telegram which they said had been filed for transmission in a Hollywood telegraph office at 10 o'clock the morning of Feb. 2, a litle more than two hours after Taylor's body was found: "Mrs. Georgia Freeman, shipping point, Stamford, Conn. " Pete Tanner fatally shot behind right ear in his apartment this morning. ask Ethel Daisy if I can do anything. Should I send flowers in Ethel Daisy's name. Consternation among movie colony. No details available yet. "MARION."   The officers stated they had obtained from Mrs. Marion Graham, a division manager for a Hollywood publication. admission she had sent the telegram and that she had known Taylor in New York under the name of Tanner, when his daughter, Ethel Daisy, was a year old. She said when she first met him in Hollywood he had denied he was Tanner, but later admitted it. Under Sheriff Biscailuz admitted today that the men working out of Sheriff Traeger 's office were almost at the end of their clues. District Attorney Woolwine, who has been aiding the inquiry. declared that nothing definite has thus far developed. The Police Department has a similar report. Because of the failure of the many "tips," "clues" and the recent "confession," some of the investigators have reverted to their original belief that Sands may hold the solution of the case Some of the very few positive ciues in the investigation have been linked somewhat definitely with Sands and despite the offer of $3,500 reward for a solution of the mystery and the nationwide appeal to find Sands, nothing of him has been learned since the slaying, more than three weeks ago. Sands is now a fugitive from justice on an embezzlement warrant and is accused of twice robbing his employer, the last robbery occurring about two months before the shooting. Aside from the slender chain of circumstances concerning Sands, the investigation is almost at the same point it was when Taylor 's body was discovered, shot through the back, in his bachelor apartments on South Alvarado Street.   Says Fields Was in Buffalo Feb. 2. INDIANAPOLIS, And., Feb, 2 .Guy Broughton, a Federal narcotic agent of this district, said tonight that Harry M. Fields, who is under arrest in Detroit, and who professes to have driven an automobile that carried the slayer of William Desmond Taylor in Los Angeles, Cal., Feb, I, could not have been in Los Angeles on that day. Broughton said he arrested Fields in Buffalo, N.Y., Feb. 2, one day after the slaying. Broughton said Fields was taken into custody on a drug "peddling" charge and later turned over to Detroit authorities, where he was wanted for passing worthless checks. Broughton expressed the opinion Fields 's story was a fabrication, picked up from details the man had read in newspapers, told in an effort to get out of his present trouble.
1922-02-28	Somebody seems to be pulling the first syllable of his name over the eyes of Attorney Woolwine, of Los Angeles.
1922-02-28	(Los Angeles)--Underwood said Taylor lived in constant terror, apparently of unseen enemies who menaced him. According to Underwood, he met Sands at Seventh and Broadway on the day following the death of Taylor. 'Well, I'm heading south. I probably won't see you again,' Underwood says Sands told him. 'Where are you going?' Underwood says he asked. 'Probably Mexico--possibly South America,' Sands replied, according to Underwood. Underwood said: 'Some weeks previous to the murder I was sitting alone in a downtown cafe when Taylor and a party of friends entered and took the table next to mine. He was in a jovial mood, and within the next thirty minutes, observing that I was alone, invited me to join his group. I accepted. 'In the party were a number of women I recognized as having seen on the motion picture screen--women that were known the world over as actresses of the first degree. I will not give their names, because I do not wish to involve any of them in this unpleasant affair. 'These same women, however, I saw on numerous occasions when I was a guest at the Taylor bungalow on Alvarado. I have my own theory regarding the slaying and the connection of these people with it, but as to this angle I have nothing to say.'
1922-02-28	Mayor Cryer was placidly cutting open his mail this morning when he came to an envelope dated from Omaha, Nebraska. He was somewhat nonplussed when he read the following letter: 'The report published in certain papers throughout the country stating that I have predicted the destruction of Los Angeles, is absolutely false. 'I have never mentioned anything of the kind. I do not predict world events with which I am not in personal contact.' After making this modest assertion denying that she has made any evil predictions concerning Los Angeles, she signs herself as Eugene Dennis, 'known as the 'Wonder Girl.' ' And to prove that she is the one and only 'wonder girl' she attached a statement from David P. Abbott, who says that he is 'the gentleman conducting the investigation of Miss Dennis for the purpose of making a report to the American Psychical Institute and Laboratory of New York City.'
