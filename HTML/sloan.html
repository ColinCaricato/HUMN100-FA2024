               <span xmlns="" style="color: green">"The Cruise of the South Sea Islands"</span>. It was rather a
               dry book, but the way <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">she</span> read it was interesting and we simply sat around <span xmlns="" style="color: red">home</span> and
               enjoyed our evening at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">home</span>, the three of us. Now I know <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">mother</span>
               was not at <span xmlns="" style="color: red">home</span>, because if <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">she</span> was, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">she</span> would have been

            <p part="N">POLICE: ** Have you talked to <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Jeanne McPherson</span> at all?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> WHITNEY: <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Jeanne</span> knows a great, big, large lot. Jeanne came over
               to see <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mary</span> <time ref="date" instant="false">a day or so after the murder</time>. She would be a good person for
               you to talk to. And her mother, <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. O'Neil</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: Well, going back to that old subject of the gun, I just wanted to be sure
               that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span> had it in the <span xmlns="" style="color: red">house</span> for a <time ref="duration" instant="false">long
                  time</time>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">WHITNEY: Oh yes, there was always a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">gun</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">POLICE: If anybody said that <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. She1by</span> did not know anything about a <span xmlns="" style="color: green">pistol</span> or
               revolver, and was afraid of one, that would not be true?</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">WHITNEY: That's ridiculous. <span xmlns="" style="color: blue;">Mrs. Shelby</span> was not afraid of anything.</p>
